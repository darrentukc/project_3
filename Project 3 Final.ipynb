    "Men In Black (MIB) is a secret association that researches & monitors the sentiment of people on aliens, whether conspiracies that are made are a little too close to things that the people should not know about. Think area 51 and the roswell incident. But, nothing is fullproof. Things get leaked out anyway. They are usually leaked to r/aliens and r/space.  Instead of completely shutting down reddit, having a subreddit like aliens would be useful for MIB to monitor what people are talking about. They they are requesting us, the Reddit Data Science team to create a model to classify reddit posts and identify the key words that differentiates the post from \"Aliens\" to \"Space\". <br><br>\n",

      "dragonfly will weigh approximately 900 kg and will be able to cover 10s of miles in under an hour. this is much more distance than any previous lander and this kind of distance is thanks to titan having a gravitational pull 1/7 of earth’s and an atmosphere 4 times as dense as earth’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "like the recent mars drone ingenuity, dragonfly will fly autonomously, using lidar and a variety of cameras to analyze the ground. dragonfly will “hop” from its current to potential landing site, scouting it for hazards and relaying that data 70-90 light minutes away to nasa to determine viability. a titan day is equivalent to about 15.9 earth days, and nasa is hoping to achieve a single hop per titan day.\n",

      "\n",
      "**communication**\n",
      "\n",
      "as there are no permanent satellites orbiting titan, dragonfly will rely on direct-to-earth communication, making use of the large dish on its top to send and receive signals directly to and from earth. during titan’s nights, dragonfly will not have line-of-sight to earth and therefore won’t be able to communicate, instead performing experiments autonomously while teams on earth look at its previously sent data.\n",

      "\n",
      "a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (which utilizes the decay of plutonium) will be used to generate power and heat for the lander. a similar device was used on the mars curiosity rover and is currently on the international space station. the heat from this will be much needed as titan’s surface can be around -290 degrees fahrenheit. while in general it is good for electronics to be cool, this temperature can definitely be too much for some of the instruments so a big challenge will be to make sure they are properly heated.\n",
      "\n",
      "while dragonfly isn’t slated to leave earth till 2026 and arrive on titian till 2034, i believe that dragonfly will be an incredible mission that deserves to be heard. i was inspired to make this after listening to a talk from one of the lead systems engineers on the entry and descent system and found this mission to be absolutely fascinating. i hope this mission interests you as well.\n",

      "&gt;tom delonge - \"the only thing that we can come down to is that there's a parallel dimension that's completely opposite of ours, opposite timeline, opposite physics and all that, which is that duality concept. it's where time goes in different directions. then i'll call up my partner, co-founder, dr. hal puthoff, that's the lead physicist on the ufo program over at the pentagon. and he'll say, \"well, what's interesting is all of our physics equations work backwards in time, as well as forward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he is talking about a parallel dimension similar to what lue said about \"inter-dimensional\".  tom is inferring one parallel dimension where that parallel dimension is composed of one time and three spatial (a -+++ metric?), while lue leaves open the possibility of more than that.  \n",
      "\n",
      "tom does not seem to be mirroring what lue is saying about a +--- metric compared to a -+++ metric. in this case, rather, tom is pointing out well-known reverse-time physics.  for example, a positron could be viewed as an electron going backwards in time.  it has been known for a very long time that anti-matter can be viewed as normal matter going backwards in time; it is one of the foundations of quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "this \"opposite timeline, opposite physics\" he is talking about would still retain the standard -+++ metric, but run in reverse time.  \n",

      "\n",
      "this is the biggest breadcrumb that ties everything together.  the key phrase is \"extend in two directions\".  this is a very ambiguous statement.  we all assume that time goes forwards and backwards, is this what tom meant by two directions? he then adds that the two time directions are at the \"exact same moment\" and the \"exact same place\".  as he stated in the 24sep2021 fader interview, and as lue's comments could have implied, time could be running both forward and backwards concurrently.  however, even this is ambiguous!  \n",
      "\n",
      "watch tom's hands as he begins to talk about the directions of time.  his hands come together at almost right angles.  this motion would imply that there would be two dimensions of time, not just one.  could this be what he means by two directions?  lue's comments even suggest three.  however, there is a distinction when it comes to looking at the spacetime metric.  tom's hand movement would imply at least a 5-component spacetime metric consisting of two time metrics and three space; --+++.  and if his other comments hold true, this would imply that the second time metric would also have a forward and reverse component, possibly running concurrently with one another.  if there is a second time metric, would it have corresponding space metrics? ++------, --++++++, -+++-+++, +---+---, +---+++- one could only guess at the metric without further information.\n",

      "\n",
      "is what tom is implying able to describe what lue was saying about the electron ebbing in and out of existence?  are electrons going to a completely different time dimension?  are they existing in real-time, then transitioning over to imaginary time somehow?  is time the hole in the fabric of space time?  if the electron is transitioning to the different, imaginary time, is it also transitioning to an imaginary space line also? \n",
      "\n",
      "there is a quantum mechanics equation that relies heavily on imaginary time.  it is the time evolution operator.  interestingly enough, it actually has ties to the macroscopic world.  take a look at the red circled part of the [equation](https://i.postimg.cc/wpy96bzj/imaginary-evolution.png).  notice the -it; that is the imaginary time component of the operator.\n",

      "from discussions above we don't even know what the full spacetime metric is.  is it the standard four, the five suggested by reading into tom's responses, the eight by extending his responses, the eight of quantum gravity, the ten of string theory, the 11 of m-theory, or the 12-14 dimensions of two-time m-theory, or something completely different?\n",

      " the united states military appears to have disseminated a **counterintelligence disinformation report amongst its allies after a crash retrieval in 1947**, in order to re-direct the narrative regarding the nature of the incident and the items recovered. the twining memo was reportedly recovered by renowned ufo researcher stanton friedman \"in a classified box in a classified vault\" in the mid-1980s (possibly by those persons going through cia ci director james jesus angleton's numerous safes after his death in 1987). it is dated september 23, 1947, and classified at the secret level. it is notable that it did not carry any dissemination limiting markers such as noforn, which means \"no foreign eyes to read\". the documents' provenance or authenticity has never been questioned and is authentic.\n",
      "\n",
      "further evidence that confirms the twining memo's authenticity is the fact that it is explicitly referenced in appendix a on page 18 in 1971 by australian professor harry turner in his report titled \"scientific and intelligence aspects of the ufo problem\", also classified at the secret level at the time it was created. this document was declassified by the australian government some years ago, however, it was only uploaded in its digital form to the national australian archives website earlier this year.\n",

      "however, the reason i am led to believe that this document was a ci product was the fact it was created a few days after a different document, the infamous twining white hot report was created. it is an explosive report detailing a crash retrieval operation of a ulat (unidentified lenticular aerodyne technology) and the recovery of the occupants near socorro, new mexico. it was dated friday 19th september 1947, and signed by president harry truman on wednesday 24th september 1947. this document was classified as majic eyes only. this classification has never appeared in any u.s. dod documentation because it is most likely an atomic energy commission classification. several members of the manhattan project leadership team appear on the distribution list: oppenheimer, groves, and einstein, with vaneaver bush's signature next to truman's. the claim that trumans' signature is fake because of markings around its perimeter that appear on other known genuine documents omits one very large detail - many executives in the 1930s and 40s had rubber stamps with their signature carved in bold relief. my grandfather had one which i still have and produces the exact same marks every time it is used. it is also notable that the tranche of documents the white hot report comes from (the majestic documents), were actually considered by stanton freidman to be authentic.\n",

      "a childhood ufo encounter, during which i heard voices in my head, led me to associate another phenomenon. this is the millions of people on this planet who hear voices that often purport to be neighbors, \"gangstalkers\", demons, spirits, or even god. at some point or other, everyone has questioned whether these voices could possibly be coming from any part of their own minds, although some end up settling for a psychiatric explanation. many others, to whom the voices are particularly manipulative and cruel, adopt a belief that some government program is using “synthetic telepathy” technology against them. lastly, there are some that believe the voices to be supernatural. in any case, there is a concerted effort to make the individual delusional and thereby destroy their credibility. the fact that voicehearers often end up delusional allows society to write off the phenomenon of voice hearing as part of a psychosis rather than one of the contributing factors to that psychosis. also, the fact that medication can help dull the impact of voices and lessen the suggestibility factor that leads to delusions lends undue credibility to the notion of some \"brain dysfunction\" being the cause of voices. there is still no brain imaging or genetic testing to diagnose conditions entailing \"auditory hallucinations\". while modern psychiatry has attempted to label many such cases as \"schizophrenia\", victims are also known to experience cranial sensations and other mental and physiological influences, which suggests neurological modification of some kind. the experience is simply too dynamic, both psychologically and neurologically, to be explained by some \"brain dysfunction\". \n",
      "\n",
      "biotechnological manipulation of the human brain that is experienced by voicehearers could only be achieved by some kind of artificially intelligent system of nanotechnology that has innervated the central nervous system. the only clue is likely the mysterious condition known as morgellons disease, in which visible particles and fibers form from smaller nanoparticles under certain circumstances we don’t understand yet. lyme disease and psychostimulant use are two of the most common circumstances, but they are not the underlying causative agent. it was initially believed to be delusional until multiple studies finally confirmed otherwise in the last five years. in peer-reviewed studies, scientists have since noted the extraordinary electrostatic properties of the fiber filaments, which are capable of movement, auto-flourescence, gas production, and lipid-like crystal formations which may resemble quantum dots. some authors associate the condition with an as-of-yet unidentified stealth pathogen:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15924873/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15924873/)\n",
      "\n",
      "in summary, i would bet my life on the laboratory hypothesis as an answer to the fermi paradox. personal experience with the above phenomena leads me to believe that some alien ai superintelligence is here on earth and has employed bionanotechnology to integrate with the central nervous system. the extent of its activity is unknown. it may simply be experimenting on a select few of us or exerting a wider and more intensive influence over the human race. discovery of its exact relationship to us should come within the next few centuries, once we have the ability to analyze said nanotechnology.\n",

      "i was reading an old ama thread that george knapp did back in 2013 and i found one of his replies really neat. it seems to predict the current uap/ufo slow disclosure that we currently find ourselves in. he was asked what he thought of the citizen hearing on disclosure that occurred in 2013. he replied (the wall of text is how he had it formatted sorry):\n",
      "\n",
      "\"  i support the general idea of disclosure and think they had a top notch  lineup--with a few clunkers thrown into the mix. however, as i  mentioned in response to another question, i do not believe disclosure  is going to happen, now or anytime. i do believe, as j. vallee has said,  that there is a treasure trove of ufo evidence somewhere because the  government is the one with the sensors and radar to collect such info,  but if it still exists, it most likely has been transferred out of the  government and into private or corporate hands so that someone like me  could never find it via foia, or--more likely--so no one in congress  could find it. i have been told by person who are highly placed and whom  i trust very much that a policy similar to disclosure is underway now.  it is something akin to confirmation of the basic core story. it is a  gradual, long term strategy and will not involve a sudden announcement  by the president. we have all heard rumors about this sort of thing in  years past. for the first time, i now believe something really is going  on.  i applaud s. bassett for his commitment to the cause. as a 1st  amendment guy, i beleive in the public's right to know, but--as  mentioned--disclosure is not going to happen, not unless it is done by  another major government or by some kind of irrefutable gesture by \"the  visitors\", whoever they might be. they seem to have shown no interest in  giving us proof positive, beyond tantalizing glimpses, so ti seems like  they favor a gradual release as well. i have not met greer but am not a  fan. every time i get an email from him, he is asking people for money,  and it always seems like the issue of the day is about him, more than  the phenomena. maybe if i had a chance to meet him face to face, i would  form a different impression. \"\n",

      "2. vice links this particular article; there can be a few reasons\n",

      "* i don't know, the above two bullet points can be wrong, but i am taking the vice article as well written, the professor credulous, hence the sun link = less salt\n",
      "\n",
      "i read the article and in it there is a mention of the memo, the sun article has two pages of it, but here is [the full one.](https://pointblank.company/memorandum.pdf)\n",
      "\n",
      "* it's basically a summary of points by dr. kit green from eric davis to bigelow and cced colm kelleher (colm is mentioned in the vice article) + emails\n",
      "* the summary goes deep into the professional thoughts of dr. kit green re: the alien autopsy video \n",
      "* here is a link to the [full autopsy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukbzcc3cfq), i am sure all of you have seen this\n",
      "* i had seen this as well and in my mind always dismissed it as fake, but never watched it to the end, where there are ibeams shown as well, which is crazy cool \n",
      "* basically dr. kit green says that the video is legit\n",
      "* you will find lots of debunking of it, but it seems it was done after the fact and the original guy that released it, santilli, just stopped giving a two after years of harassment and went silent. \n",
      "\n",
      "i also researched the areas that dr. green mentioned were missing in the brain, or different from human anatomy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. no corpus callosum -- this is an area that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. lack of this in humans is known as **agenesis** of corpus callosum, which results in epilepsy, retardation, or can be mild and go unnoticed, also \"some patients may have deep-set eyes and a prominent forehead. an abnormally small head (microcephaly), or sometimes an unusually **large head** (macrocephaly), may be present.\"\n",
      "2. no sylvian fissure -- is essentially a deep layer within the brain that separates the frontal lobe and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe. it's functions are \"allow\\[ing\\] for continued growth, overall increasing brain function.,\" ... \"speech production and speech recognition were organized as a kind of two-lane, two-way highway around the sylvian fissure. \"**damage** above the sylvian fissure, in the parietal and frontal lobes, tended to cause speech production deficits; damage below the sylvian fissure, in the temporal lobe, tended to cause speech recognition deficits. these results provide new evidence that the cortex around the sylvian fissure houses separable neural specializations for speech recognition and production.\n",
      "3. no temporal lobe -- \"the function of the temporal lobe centers around auditory stimuli, memory, and emotion.\" **damage** to the temporal lobe(s) can cause \"difficulty placing words or pictures into categories. language can be affected by temporal lobe damage. left temporal lesions disturb recognition of words. right temporal damage can cause a loss of inhibition of talking.\"\n",
      "4. no occipital lobe -- vision center. lack of this does necessarily indicate no vision, it can mean maybe \"[color agnosia](https://www.flintrehab.com/agnosia/) is similar to normal color blindness. except whereas color blindness affects color *perception*, color agnosia affects color *knowledge*.\" -- this can explain the lenses on the [eyes at 10:23](https://youtu.be/pukbzcc3cfq?t=623), you can see the \"physicians\" removing it from the eyes.\n",
      "5. no vernix -- \"babies without vernix might have drier skin than others.\"  not sure if this is the reference here. there is an area in the brain called **wernicke's** area, which is responsible for \"it is located in the temporal lobe on the left side of the brain and is responsible for the comprehension of speech.\" \"when this area of the brain is **damaged**, a disorder known as wernicke's aphasia can result, with the person being able to speak in phrases that sound fluent yet lack meaning.\"\n",
      "6. no cerebellum -- \"the cerebellum (“little brain”) is a structure that is **located at the back of the brain** although the cerebellum accounts for approximately 10% of the brain's volume, it contains over 50% of the total number of neurons in the brain.\"... \"it helps coordinate motion and ensures that you remain balanced and controlled in daily life. when the motor cortex in your cerebrum tells part of your body to move, the cerebellum makes sure that motion happens in the right way.\"... \"even though the cerebellum has so many neurons and takes up so much space, it is possible to survive without it, and a few people have. there are nine known cases of cerebellar agenesis, a condition where this structure never develops....people with cerebellar agenesis are clumsy. most can walk (though they may need a cane), but fine motor skills like writing, typing, and speaking are a challenge. their speech is never quite perfect and their handwriting is always a bit off.\" this might explain why the alien has six fingers, maybe for better coordination: offshoot speculation; take this with insane amounts of grains of salticles.\n",
      "7. no medulla oblongata -- \"the medulla oblongata plays a critical role in transmitting signals between the spinal cord and the higher parts of the brain and in controlling autonomic activities, such as heartbeat and respiration\" ... and apparently \"**life cannot be sustained without the work of the medulla oblongata**.\" .. this might explain why the **heart**, as mentioned in the [memo](https://pointblank.company/memorandum.pdf) (page 6), as \"a single contiguous non-muscular vessel through the heart\" ... my guess is that since there is less regulation of it from the brain, thats why its a single vessel vs the five vessels in a human heart. just from my brief 2 min search from google, i have no idea on biology.\n",
      "8. no rugae -- the ridges on the brain. i am not sure what the lack of this constitutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's peculiar that professor nolan (stanford) mentions kit green and studied these areas from the mris of  brains of injured/innate people. i am taking a leap of faith and drawing a conclusion that there is a correlation between the lack of areas in the alien brain and the hyper availability of **caudate** and the **putamen of the \"in contact\"** people. also, maybe the lack of emotions as observed from our perspective of emotions might also be due to their inherent brain structure. (super late as i am writing this, will reread tomorrow and see if what i wrote makes sense)/\n",
      "\n",
      "also, ibeams at the end of the video as mentioned in the roswell crash, had not seen that before. \n",
      "\n",
      "anyways, thought to share my train of thoughts, hopefully leads to some insight. \n",
      "\n",

      "ok for the purpose of this post. let's assume both the multiverse theory and aliens are real and true. how would you guys progress both of these theories at once? i find it interesting people don't talk about the multiverse that much and bring the multiverse up in conversations when it comes to the topic of alien life. now i understand that both topics are technically unrelated (unless you think aliens are interdimensional beings and think dimensions are different universes). but the multiverse is big enough to include aliens. since well, aliens are a part of the multiverse in the first place just like us lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "if one world is universe 1. and another world is universe 2. both universe 1 and 2 can have the earth as a planet existing in their universes. so an alien race from mars can exist in both universe 1 and 2. the planet mars alone can exist in both universe 1 and 2. earth isn't the only planet that would exist in multiple universes. maybe in some universe the planet mars actually have life. therefore just how there can be more than one earth in the multiverse. the same logic would imply to any other planets where aliens could possibly live on too.\n",
      "\n",
      "the multiverse can also be about different alternative timelines too (right?). for example, you have a redshirt in universe 1. while you may have a blue shirt in universe 2. this is just a multiverse possibility on a very very very small scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "a multiverse possibility on a big scale. would be disclosure about aliens existing, taking decades to happen in our world. like we would get disclosure in 2030 or something (or never lol). but in another world or other worlds disclosure about aliens existing to the public already happen in the 70s or something. see where i'm going with this post here.\n",

      "so earlier today i was listening to an episode of sasquatch odyssey and a man was talking about alien abductions. he had an experience from when he was a kid and got hypnotized and remembered a time where he actually had an abduction when he thought he and his friend almost got killed by a speeding vehicle. long story short it made me think of my niece who is 3 years old now. these images of me imagining her in her room with 3 beings around her bed and her kind of laughing and a light shining in through her window just kinda popped in my head. it was moreso of me thinking if something like that were to happen to her and her remembering the scenario and telling her parents and what their reaction would be. so in my head it was straight up a scenario i thought of in my head because of the story i heard. fast forward to later tonight and my brother texts me saying &lt;ill use a different name for her&gt;, “lisa said this is the people who come from the sky. they come at night with a big light.” so immediately i’m just like, “what thee actual fuck,” in my head. i immediately facetimed and i asked if he was fucking around with me but he said she just started drawing it. i tried asking who they were in a calming matter but she just seemed really agitated. we’ll obviously try to see if maybe she saw some tv show or movie and is getting it from that, but the thing that got me was how i thought of it earlier and the same day she starts drawing about it. i understand people will say it’s a coincidence and that’s fine. i’m trying to wrap my head around it, i believe in these kinds of things but im also skeptical. i also listen to these various podcasts of the paranormal every single day and it’s just weird that what i pictured in my head seems to have come into fruition. anyways i hope this is the right place to post something like this if not ill post elsewhere. thank you guys for any inputhttps://i.imgur.com/hf4b8go.jpg\n",

      "\n",
      "\"do you see that?\" they said, not looking away. i confirmed and we both stared with a growing sense of unease. something about looking at the apparition was deeply unsettling. we started to debate about the best course of action: running back to the car or standing our ground to see if the lights really were just a plane. we lasted up until the points of light became the front lights of a triangle-shaped silhouette now hovering 400 feet in the air on the other side of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "we went back to the car laughing and deciding it was not worth it to risk probing while tripping. they drove as i kept staring out the front windshield in disbelief. the object looked like a snub-nose compact version of the [lockheed f-117 nighthawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_f-117_nighthawk). two white lights shone out the front while a tiny red light blinked from one wing and a blue light blinked from the other. these lights blinked from the top of the object. i noticed a yellow light-emitting out the bottom. the silhouette had become the vague shape of an object and was eyecatching in the cloudless sky and bright moon.\n",

      "\n",
      "there was a sequel encounter. a few months later we were eating dinner in the early afternoon at the same spot. a light rain deterred everyone from coming to the park. i was eating takeout sushi when i spotted a pair of yellow headlights in the hazy grey clouds that hung low over the lake. a cone of illumination came from each one like a car in the fog, but the car was hanging stationary about 300 feet on the other side of the lake in a dense cloud. we both saw it. neither of us could make out the details of the object besides the two shining lights that faded after a couple of minutes. we were both sober this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "interestingly enough there are a few lockheed martin facilities in the state with one being based out of a fort's airfield. so maybe it was an experimental aircraft? of course, the drugs involved with the first sighting made it feel impossible to tell anyone because who would (rightfully) believe us? has anyone had similar experiences in the southeast?\n",
      "the matter of the \"skinny bob\" footage isn't going to be resolved by thinking or talking through it. but let me lay out a (minimally substantiated, it's true) case here, which some may find helpful or intriguing. my opinion centers mostly around the detail of the eyes -- specifically, the eyelids.\n",
      "\n",
      "people's experiences with greys tend to cohere around a group of commonalities, and one of them is the sense that greys appear to have foregone the usage of certain parts of their body in favor of other developments: for example, telepathy supplants vocalized speech. in a couple of cases, people have heard greys produce guttural or buzzing sounds, but it's not clear if this is a basic form of linguistic communication or something else. anyway, abductees often describe greys communicating with them mentally, sometimes implanting images. abductees also describe greys' mouths as unmoving, or barely moving, slits; and the noses as having been pretty much reduced to a pair of holes. overall, greys' bodies seem to be anatomically weak, comprised of obviously vestigial parts, and ultimately in service of a predominant mental capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "the most distinctive aspect of the greys' appearance is their large and black eyes. i recently read raymond fowler's book, *the watchers*, which details part of abductee betty andreason luca's experiences. in one of her accounts, luca describes observing greys placing a (hybrid?) fetus in glass containment chamber, but -- here's the kicker -- not before *circumcising the eyelids*: meaning, in effect, that the being would either be *incapable of blinking*, or that blinking would be another kind of vestigial act, and that the eyelids would *not cover the whole eyes* when being used to blink.\n",
      "\n",
      "consequently, the most suggestive detail for me in the \"skinny bob\" footage center on the eyes and lids. [the figure in the footage indeed blinks, but note how *the lids only seem to cover an upper portion of the eyes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxcqiys2u-0). this could be a trick of the lighting. there are very heavy shadows around that region of the face. but if the lids are indeed only partially brought down, this would be a bizarrely specific detail for hoaxers to have included.\n",
      "\n",
      "as a side note, i would say that, for me, the most compelling part of the alleged et/ut/ct footage from the 1997 documentary, [*area 51: the alien interview*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdzv3vgzwo&amp;t=1934s), is precisely that which compels some people to laughingly dismiss it offhand: that is, the fact that the figure appears to have practically no facial movement besides a slight opening of the mouth when it is ostensibly in distress, and also appears to have an almost comically weak coordination between its head and body. it seems to me that if one wanted to fake footage, in the late 90s, which would be guaranteed to have a sensational effect, one would prioritize a model whose expression and bodily movement wasn't so inorganically static and puppet-like, respectively speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "p.s.: i think that luca's account of the greys tampering with fetal development brings up at least one immediate question, which is: if the fetuses ostensibly *become* the greys (which is what luca says the greys told her), what would a grey have been like *before* fetal tampering?\n",
      "wondering about the process other alien life would go through i always seem to arrive that they at least must have organic minds and must feed themselves in some way and i growing food does seem to be a reasonable conclusion to their quest for survival.\n",

      "now contemplate how unlikely it is that our civilizations happend to develop and advance within 200 years of one another... they could be 500 years ahead of us, 1,000 years, 10,000 years. they could have technology we don't even comprehend, based on science that we haven't even started to realize. our most advanced weapons could be laughably primitive, easily destroyed, posing absolutely no threat.\n",
      "* **the possibility that we** ***could*** **reach technological parity with an alien civilization might force them to destroy us pre-emptively.** think again about how far human technology has progressed in just 200 years. that's a technological explosion. we went from agrarian societies to industrialization in the blink of an eye on a cosmic scale.  \n",
      "in another 200 years, humanity could take gigantic, transformative technological leaps we can scarcely imagine, and that fact alone could make us a defacto threat to any other intelligent civilization.  \n",
      "we often believe that a sufficiently advanced civilization wouldn't worry about us because they could easily overpower us, so we present no threat. but we could grow into a very real threat that can no longer be contained, or a niusance that gets in the way of their plans. either way, we'd be fully at their mercy to decide our fate.  \n",
      "whichever civilization holds the asymmetrical edge in technology directly threatens the existence of their neighbors, or at the very least threatens to expand so rapidly as to take all the nearby resources they depend on for their own expansion. so if you allow any intelligent species to develop unchecked, there's a chance that they could some day subjugate you or annihilate you.\n",
      "* **we can't know the true intentions of any alien civilization.** we think about aliens in the same way as we might think about two different human civlizations meeting. but there's a possibility that there would be such stark differences in our evolutionary biology that we might seem incomprehensible to one another. our motives, our thought processes, our survival strategies, our willingness to trust one another - it's all in question. we already struggle to treat fellow humans with dignity based on the tiniest differences in skin color or culture.  \n",
      "even if we assure one another that we intend to be peaceful, how can we be certain? if one side or the other lies and gains a technological advantage, you again run the risk of extermination. that causes suspicion, and that suspicion causes fear, and that fear could, again, motivate pre-emptive annihilation. if you guess wrong and assume a violent civilization is friendly, the cost is extinction, and therefore the stakes are as high as possible.\n",
      "* **it may be that we've never found an alien civilization because being found leads to destruction.** given the number of stars in the galaxy and the age of the universe, the chance that no other life exists in the cosmos seems unlikely, and yet, small as our sample size is, we've never found evidence of intelligent life (fermi paradox). it could be that life is harder to develop than we realize. it could be that they developed much farther away than we can see or contact. or it could be that they are hiding.  \n",
      "if we take all of these ideas together, the best strategy for any civilization to survive is to stay hidden. if you can't be found, you can't be killed. if you can't be killed, you can expand and advance until you become the dominant civilization that's no longer threatened. and if you become the dominant civilization, you may have to eradicate everyone else you find to protect your hegemony.\n",
      "* **if we have indeed encountered extraterrestrial space craft on earth or found evidence of et civlizations, governements may choose not to disclose this information to keep panic and risk at a minimum.** military thinkers no doubt have contemplated these exact issues before. if we do indeed have reason to believe aliens have found earth or are aware of our existence in some way, they may not reveal this information because of the potential for instability.  \n",
      "we have no idea how the planet as a whole would react to this information. even if we did, there's probably nothing we could realistically do to thwart an alien threat to life on earth. we're the cosmic equivalent of newly evolved human beings who haven't even ventured out of africa yet. we're ignorant and vulnerable to an absurd degree.\n",

      "the nimitz leak was first posted on a german cgi forum, and days later on ats. this was a decade before the pentagon re-leaked it as part of their now obvious campaign. but here's the catch... the cut of the clip is exactly the same. the original \"whistleblower\" mentioned the original obviously being longer, and that the craft zipped away, just as fravor described it a decade later.\n",
      "\n",
      "the pentagon essentially released the exact same video file that was leaked a decade earlier. so, considering the other factors, the innitial \"whistleblower\" leak, was purposefuly cut to hide the most striking segment where the craft zipps away... by the pentagon. and the \"leaker\" claimed they cut that clip him themselves, after accessing it from the data drive while still on the nimitz, iirc. regardless, that's an intelligence cut, not a \"whistleblower\" cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "and here's essentially how i suspect this went down: they cut the clip to a format that is informative but not too revealing, they post it on a german cgi forum to have built-in plausible deniability, then make the main post on ats with a cover story impersonating a whistleblower... then the in-house debunkers and \"shills\" get to work debunking... maybe with aftual involvement from undercover operatives on that forum... and they manage to construct a narrative that they can use to \"conclude\" it is fake. even getting as petty as to insult the uploader and call them names. central to this was the german cgi forum original post. so the video stays in the public domain gathering recognition for it's existance and possible yet \"unprovable\" validity, among the public... then, when the main propaganda operation is ready to use this \"sleeper asset\", they re-leak it and validate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "the video has had enough time to both garner attention and a following... but also has had time to behave as a trial run.\n",

      "there are pundits in both these camps. no matter what the truth is, the general population is not getting the whole story. in reality the most probable situation is a composite of both these scenarios. the history of sightings goes back for centuries and hundreds of “whistleblowers” have given testimonies in the last fifty years attesting to the existence of such technology. after reading this information a knowledgeable ufo investigator will understand how difficult it may be to conclude from an objects behavior which scenario it belongs to.  \n",

      "the evidence uncovered from my research leads me to understand that the whole ufo phenomenon is kept secret primarily not because of the \"et\" aspect of it, - although that does scare some people out of their mind, but mainly because of the ramifications which would inevitably cause the current economic and geopolitical structure to collapse. a collapse which is inevitable due to the consequences of the technology related to sustenance, energy and travel. as it turns out, this scares some other people completely out of their mind. these are the people who currently control the world systems of culture, economy, and energy. these are the people we get our information from, and who make public and economic policy decisions “in our best interest”. these are the people who decide who has “the need to know”.  \n",
      "what would happen to the current \"control structures\" which exist now if that type of technology were actually revealed and used to its full potential? what happens to an economy which is based on the consumption of fuels when the cost of such energy becomes zero? imagine removing energy cost from every product. what happens when recycling becomes a zero cost endeavor and all consumption is only a onetime depletion? the whole “planned obsolescence” which keeps you buying consumables goes right out the window. what happens when travel becomes limitless with zero “cost”? where do our boundaries go?  \n",
      "what happens to culture? this leads one to imagine a society where anyone can have anything, anytime, and go anywhere: a world where \"waste\" doesn't exist because energy concerns are irrelevant in the recycling process. a completely different existence where there is no need for any type of economy - because it's imaginary anyway. a society where all necessities are a right, free to all and you're only life goal is to explore, learn and contribute to the existence of the whole. zero strife, zero stress, and zero conflict: a world completely different in every aspect in comparison to what exists today. the challenges would only be sociological acceptance and change, and not the perceived difficulties of limits on resources and illusionary struggle for necessities.  \n",
      "what would happen to the people who kept this secret when it is disclosed this has existed for who knows how long and the population realizes what has been done to them and the planet for so long, only for their “rulers'” own selfish control based gains? what happens when the population of the planet realizes about the untold numbers of unnecessary deaths which occurred because of this situation?  \n",

      "i can’t help but think of the end scene in the movie “the day the earth stood still” (1951) in which the visiting alien states “it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet. but if you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. we shall be waiting for your answer; the decision rests with you.”  \n",
      "the possibilities are on the extremes and quite obvious. we can either grow into a peaceful and self perpetuating society or continue on our current path to certain demise because of the diminishing resources we consume. this consumption will inevitably result in wars over those resources, leading to certain destruction of our planet.  \n",
      "there is only one wise choice. it's my opinion that this has taken far too long to be actualized. the deep resistance to a severe societal and control change appears to be drastic and unacceptable to far too many. i believe this is why the whole ufo scenario is still a secret; not because of the existence of \"off-world\" intelligences. i think that's a nearsighted and readily available excuse; an illusion perpetuated by the fear-based focus on emotional misunderstandings. this conclusion is revealed by the close examination of the \"abduction\" scenarios. most humans immediately resonate in fear after a contact scenario. their immediate emotional response is understandable. they are confronted with paradigm shifting realizations, and situations which are out of their normal realm. but when the data is analyzed, most of the evidence point to the aliens’ intent as promoting evolution/enlightenment and a deep care for the planet and all the occupants of the earth itself. there is an abundance of data provided by psychotherapists who have many years of regression therapy sessions which attribute to this conclusion. i believe aliens have this viewpoint because they understand the entanglement principle of quantum physics to its fullest reality; just as all the sages of antiquity have professed, - everything is connected.  \n",
      "meanwhile, advertisers have known for years that fear is an excellent motivator and closes down rational thought. one must logically conclude if aliens are here and wanted “resources” from us - as a certain well known physicists has recently claimed, in the centuries of reported encounters they certainly could have taken whatever they wanted. their obviously superior technology could have easily destroyed us already. we’re still here. it’s plain to see they don’t need our resources and that’s not their plan. as i’ve said earlier, “they’re not packing their lunch for the trip”. they seem to have everything they need. using fear, the people who refuse to accept this change perpetuate false realities for their own agendas while inhibiting the natural progress of human technological advancements, and by extension retarding the evolution of human consciousness.  \n",

      "in 1969, a small group of people at douglas aircraft took the ufo phenomenon seriously enough to spend a reported $500 million investigating the properties of the propulsion involved. the document (a-830-bb01-jmb-2) drafted june 25, 1968 outlines the program in general. they began by proposing very simple experiments to determine any attraction or reaction between magnetic fields and electrostatic charges arranged in a circle, the purpose being to simulate the dynamics of elementary particles (specifically the electron) on a macrocosmic scale (proposal for electrostatic/magnetic experiments, december 20, 1967, pp. 7-8). according to the memorandum \"currently preferred propulsion concept\" (a-830-bb01-jmb-1) dated february 14, 1968 the author exhibits his confidence in the specific experimental approaches. robert wood discusses the program on pages 433-440 of hyperlink \"[http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm](http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm)\" \\\\l \"disclosure%20book\" steven greer's book “disclosure”. among the things to be noted: page 435, wood and co. briefed the condon committee which was ongoing at the same time. they explained that it was possible to make a superconductive ring of current float in the earth's magnetic field with only 10 times the current capacity that they had available at that time. \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php](http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php)? option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38\" [http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38\\]](http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38]) and \\[“a little physics...a little friction”, by robert m. wood, iur july/august 1993\\]  \n",

      "this nasa supported research abstract goes on to say: “a new propulsion concept has been developed based on a proposed resonance between coherent, pulsed electromagnetic wave forms and gravitational wave forms (or space-time metrics). using this concept a spacecraft \"propulsion\" system potentially capable of galactic and inter-galactic travel without prohibitive \"travel times\" has been designed. the \"propulsion\" system utilizes recent research associated with magnetic field line merging, hydromagnetic wave effects, free-electron lasers, laser generation of megagauss fields, and special structural and containment metals. research required to determine potential, field resonance characteristics and to evaluate various aspects of the spacecraft \"propulsion\" design is described.”  \n",
      "it then goes on to describe some of the evidence and data from which it draws its conclusions: “if some ufo phenomena are caused by extraterrestrial visitors in very advanced spacecraft, then the frequency of visits and the larger number of different types of visitors (many different humanoids have been described) imply an ability to cross large stretches of galactic and inter-galactic space in relatively short time frames. if the speed of light is a true limit of velocity in space-time, then the potential extraterrestrial visitors must utilize a form of transportation which transcends space and time to keep the trip times short. ufos are often observed to disappear instantaneously. in a subset of these cases, the ufo later reappears at a nearby location implying a disappearance from and a reappearance into space-time. the high speed, right angle turns, abrupt stops or accelerations of ufos, and the absence of sonic booms despite calculated speeds of 22,000 mph or more suggest that ufos may generate an artificial gravitational field or otherwise use properties of space-time which we are not familiar with. ufo propulsion systems appear to involve electromagnetic or hydromagnetic processes as evidenced by radiative effects on the environment such as burns, dehydration, stopping of automobile engines, tv and radio disruptions, melting or alteration of ground and road surfaces, power disruptions, and static electricity effects. this data suggests that the unknown relationship between electromagnetic and gravitational fields may be used in ufo propulsion systems.” \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800010907\\_1980010907.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800010907_1980010907.pdf)\" http:// ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800010907\\_1980010907.pdf\\]  \n",

(forward 1990) we propose that we have indeed found a new insight into the nature of mass, and while this immediately rules out the possibility of negative matter discussed above and its consequent hypothetical propulsion capabilities, it opens an equally revolutionary opportunity: the chance that inertia and gravitation, as electromagnetically-based phenomena, may be subject to modification.” \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf\\_staif98.pdf](http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf_staif98.pdf)\" [http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf\\_staif98.pdf\\]](http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf_staif98.pdf])  \n",

      "there are a number of u.s. patents which describe what has become to be known as “overunity devices”. these devices create more energy as a product than they require for operation. the argument against that comes from people who cite the “law of conservation of energy” which states that the amount of energy created will always be equal to or less than that which is input”. the caveat is that law applies only to a “closed system” and these devices work on “open system” theories. these devices receive most of their energy from the active environment, which current physics hasn’t yet incorporated into their calculations. think of it like this; current physics counts the gas tank of your car along with the engine as a closed system. the only source of energy is what is held by that gas tank. in an open system the tank would be constantly filled from an outside source as it uses its reserves, but current physics can’t count that because it doesn’t understand how it’s being refueled. in an open system it would appear to conventional physics as if energy was created from nothingness because they couldn’t detect the filling mechanism. in these cases the filling mechanism is the electromagnetic fabric of the space/time reality which supports matter as we understand it. it’s where atoms get their energy from. another simple example is a waterwheel. the river is the source of the water. that water is replenished from rainfall. that rainfall is an example of an open system, and can’t be adequately calculated.\n",

      "i can’t help but think of the end scene in the movie “the day the earth stood still” (1951) in which the visiting alien states “it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet. but if you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. we shall be waiting for your answer; the decision rests with you.”  \n",
      "the possibilities are on the extremes and quite obvious. we can either grow into a peaceful and self perpetuating society or continue on our current path to certain demise because of the diminishing resources we consume. this consumption will inevitably result in wars over those resources, leading to certain destruction of our planet.  \n",
      "there is only one wise choice. it's my opinion that this has taken far too long to be actualized. the deep resistance to a severe societal and control change appears to be drastic and unacceptable to far too many. i believe this is why the whole ufo scenario is still a secret; not because of the existence of \"off-world\" intelligences. i think that's a nearsighted and readily available excuse; an illusion perpetuated by the fear-based focus on emotional misunderstandings. this conclusion is revealed by the close examination of the \"abduction\" scenarios. most humans immediately resonate in fear after a contact scenario. their immediate emotional response is understandable. they are confronted with paradigm shifting realizations, and situations which are out of their normal realm. but when the data is analyzed, most of the evidence point to the aliens’ intent as promoting evolution/enlightenment and a  \n",
      " deep care for the planet and all the occupants of the earth itself. there is an abundance of data provided by psychotherapists who have many years of regression therapy sessions which attribute to this conclusion. i believe aliens have this viewpoint because they understand the entanglement principle of quantum physics to its fullest reality; just as all the sages of antiquity have professed, - everything is connected.  \n",
      "meanwhile, advertisers have known for years that fear is an excellent motivator and closes down rational thought. one must logically conclude if aliens are here and wanted “resources” from us - as a certain well known physicists has recently claimed, in the centuries of reported encounters they certainly could have taken whatever they wanted. their obviously superior technology could have easily destroyed us already. we’re still here. it’s plain to see they don’t need our resources and that’s not their plan. as i’ve said earlier, “they’re not packing their lunch for the trip”. they seem to have everything they need. using fear, the people who refuse to accept this change perpetuate false realities for their own agendas while inhibiting the natural progress of human technological advancements, and by extension retarding the evolution of human consciousness.  \n",
      "we’re rapidly approaching an opportunity to prepare our society to be ready to have an equal and bidirectional relationship with our galactic neighbors. we should not be wasting that chance. we should be ready when that time comes. this isn’t about “disclosure” just yet. we’re not ready for that. we’ve only just begun to understand what that would mean. we first need to stop being “the planet of the children” and grow up.  \n",

      "this nasa supported research abstract goes on to say: “a new propulsion concept has been developed based on a proposed resonance between coherent, pulsed electromagnetic wave forms and gravitational wave forms (or space-time metrics). using this concept a spacecraft \"propulsion\" system potentially capable of galactic and inter-galactic travel without prohibitive \"travel times\" has been designed. the \"propulsion\" system utilizes recent research associated with magnetic field line merging, hydromagnetic wave effects, free-electron lasers, laser generation of megagauss fields, and special structural and containment metals. research required to determine potential, field resonance characteristics and to evaluate various aspects of the spacecraft \"propulsion\" design is described.”  \n",
      "it then goes on to describe some of the evidence and data from which it draws its conclusions: “if some ufo phenomena are caused by extraterrestrial visitors in very advanced spacecraft, then the frequency of visits and the larger number of different types of visitors (many different humanoids have been described) imply an ability to cross large stretches of galactic and inter-galactic space in relatively short time frames. if the speed of light is a true limit of velocity in space-time, then the potential extraterrestrial visitors must utilize a form of transportation which transcends space and time to keep the trip times short. ufos are often observed to disappear instantaneously. in a subset of these cases, the ufo later reappears at a nearby location implying a disappearance from and a reappearance into space-time. the high speed, right angle turns, abrupt stops or accelerations of ufos, and the absence of sonic booms despite calculated speeds of 22,000 mph or more suggest that ufos may generate an artificial gravitational field or otherwise use properties of space-time which we are not familiar with. ufo propulsion systems appear to involve electromagnetic or hydromagnetic processes as evidenced by radiative effects on the environment such as burns, dehydration, stopping of automobile  \n",

(forward 1990) we propose that we have indeed found a new insight into the nature of mass, and while this immediately rules out the possibility of negative matter discussed above and its consequent hypothetical propulsion capabilities, it opens an equally revolutionary opportunity: the chance that inertia and gravitation, as electromagnetically-based phenomena, may be subject to modification.” \\[source: hyperlink \"http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf\\_staif98.pdf\" http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf\\_staif98.pdf\\]  \n",

      "dr. greer has presented this repeatedly to government authorities but to this day there has been neither public acknowledgement nor action, which i believe is primarily because of the economic and societal concerns stated toward the beginning of this article. the reasons and methods for the suppression as he’s discovered are included in section 1.5 of that document and are numerous. they are documented and witnessed by people directly interviewed by dr. greer. the conclusion of that section states “considering the multiplicity of suppression techniques described above, a lone inventor or conventional r and d company can in no way overcome such obstacles. therefore, a strategic plan and capability commensurate with these barriers must be devised and executed in order for these new technologies to succeed.” \\[source: hyperlink \"http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf\" http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf\\] dr. greer’s paper does an excellent job of demonstrating such a strategic plan to accomplish that goal.  \n",
      "there are a number of u.s. patents which describe what has become to be known as “overunity devices”. these devices create more energy as a product than they require for operation. the argument against that comes from people who cite the “law of conservation of energy” which states that the amount of energy created will always be equal to or less than that which is input”. the caveat is that law applies only to a “closed system” and these devices work on “open system” theories. these devices receive most of their energy from the active environment, which current physics hasn’t yet incorporated into their calculations. think of it like this; current physics counts the gas tank of your car along with the engine as a closed system. the only source of energy is what is held by that gas tank. in an open system the tank would be constantly filled from an outside source as it uses its reserves, but current physics can’t count that because it doesn’t understand how it’s being refueled. in an open system it would appear to conventional physics as if energy was created from nothingness because they couldn’t detect the filling mechanism. in these cases the filling mechanism is the electromagnetic fabric of the space/time reality which supports matter as we understand it. it’s where atoms get their energy from. another simple example is a waterwheel. the river is the source of the water. that water is replenished from rainfall. that rainfall is an example of an open system, and can’t be adequately calculated.  \n",

      "\n",
      "if they are genetically self-modified they may have evolved past the need to carry infants, assuming they once gave live birth, and developed synthetic wombs, which additionally may allow prolonged brain growth, sort of like having a fourth trimester. \n",

      "not all technological influences may be spiritually dangerous as laid out above (and it goes without saying also physically dangerous). some might be beneficial to the evolution of higher spiritual natures and consciousness. for example, humans diverged from other large animals on this planet in several ways linked to technological progress. early human societies congregated at rivers and other rich locations and collectively managed resources in what might be called a proto-agricultural lifestyle, with horticulture, animal capture, livestock management ( [ecology and society: salmon, science, and reciprocity on the northwest coast](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art43/)) use of preparation to seperate the inedible and toxic, fire and cooking to harvest wild grains and other plants to supplement food. construction of physical structures was used to corral migratory herd animals together so that that the local human population density could be increased greatly. compare us with bears. bears have large food requirement and only occasional interact closely at locations where the food supply can temporarily sustain them, such as on the river bank. the inability of bears to cooperate results in them having to live apart and police their large personal ranges as mostly solitary animals as there is insufficient food for concentrations of bears to form for long periods. \n",
      "\n",
      "humans changed the food supply by food preparation, knowledge and later by fire, so the bioavailable fraction of energy in an area is greater, so humans could form larger villages and societies, eventually leading to civilisation, with writing, money and laws. we use each other as tools, so we do not need to carry more than a pair of limbs for manipulating anything, and through our social nature, we can amplify our ability to engineer. \n",
      "\n",
      "the higher population density in turn allow for cultures to mix, bringing multiple innovations together, accelerating this process. we could call this *techno-spiritual evolution*. as this process yielded eventually professional farmers, we can see that to kill or harm a farmer - our neighbour - reduces the total available food supply, so we would all be fighting more over what remained, and therefore harming ourselves. we therefore are better adapted not to kill our neighbours. without professional farmers, we would reduce our food supply and be preoccupied with feeding ourselves, and not able to develop specialisations like weaving and shoe making.\n",
      "\n",
      "humans have the longest childhoods in the known animal kingdom, i believe only shared with the orangutan, which is the second most intelligent primate after us. it suggests that childhood length and intelligence are intrinsically linked. human infants more so have extraordinary nutrient demand for brain growth - a new born human beings brain uses about half of all the energy intake, which is an extraordinary fraction. this is dependent on secure food supply, and therefore the ability to optimise the food production of our environment by either high intelligence or use of technology, like fishing, corralling wild animals and spears for hunting, cooking, and having excellent memory and cultural knowledge for what is and isn't edible, and how to prepare it so it is so. \n",
      "\n",
      "our ancestors probably also travelled in organised ways to better harvest the land over the different seasons, having excellent geographical knowledge and awareness of natural cycles, in order to optimise their food security.\n",
      "\n",
      "all this, seems important to the development of an animal with an unusually large brain to body ratio and brain metabolic fraction of total energy intake. we see bigger brained animals than us, like elephants and whales, but their brains generally simply scale with size, so the fraction of nutrients consumed by the brain is much less. this along with the physical stress of giving birth with narrow hips to large crania and the strain of supporting it on land and a small physical frame, shows that humans have been under a large-brain selection pressure for a prolonged time, moreso than any other animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "this in turn, is quite possibly, at least in the later stages, a result of our bodies being well adapted, as bipeds, to physically manipulating the environment, and so the benefit of a bigger brain with more generalised intelligence, or consciousness, may provide a bigger evolutionary advantage in such bodies of this physical form, enough to overcome the survival reducing effect of higher energy use, and the balance between these two counter-acting forces being what makes our evolution of large brains so fast. we could say, that the brain to body ratio follows the form, as the physical form provides the power to physically translate higher intelligence into a survival advantage to each increase in intelligence. this also is to say, that technology is a natural part of the driver for higher intelligence and consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "so strong has been the selective pressure to higher intelligence been in humans that we have not only comparatively large brains, but as compared to our cetacean friends, our brains are unusually integrated and well connected, whereas in the huge brained whales, the brain is more composed of lobes that process different functions in isolation. when we think, we use more of our brain, due to a more developed connectome, which means that the equivalent brain volume would be higher, showing that we have continued to push the envelop out of how much brain we can use on a task beyond the physical limits of our frames. so our virtual brain size is larger than it looks (birds also have this feature through even more dense neural packing and less glia per neuron).\n",

      "here we see an idea i think is very important as to 'why us', this strange bipedal mammal with the extremely strong brain selection, 'domain-general cognition'. this phrase seems to me to be broadly equivalent to consciousness, and i assume that is the case. although human consciousness has probably additional aspects that may be a result of socialisation and thereby identity, such as awareness of self, and awareness of awareness. many animals possess intelligence and enough domain-general cognition, that simply increasing the brain size results in an enhanced ability to deploy tools or behaviors, individually or socially, that results in a better environment for them. if the bird had no beak, it might not have been able to evolve that much intelligence, since beaks are in part tools, in the absence of upper limbs that can be used to manipulate. the elephant too, has a trunk, and it has the largest brain of any animal on land, it can't use its forelimbs well as they are weight bearing. \n",
      "\n",
      "having the existence of these gives higher intelligence an increased survival advantage despite its increased energy cost, so it changes the set-point to a relatively bigger brain compared to closely related species; so the brain seems to follow form, but form cannot be very advantageous either without some kind of domain-general cognition. so they are in a positive feedback loop, and humans manifest an obvious example of it. perhaps this implies that aliens also are commonly humanoid.\n",

      "where *physical translatability* here relates to the ability to modify the environment by the physical form, i.e. has dexterous limbs that are free of supporting the body, and that social intelligence also increases this by allowing people to share effort and limbs, and this also creates an amplifier to increased domain-generalised intelligence by knowledge sharing, and *energy cost* would also include childhood and parenting, and be sensitive more to the ratio of energy used by the brain to the body, and *physical cost* i.e. having to support mass affects the ability to move, the physical strain of carrying the baby and giving birth to a large head. note that in humans, childhood interactions with parents have a huge impact on intelligence, as well as through schools, according to prof james flynn. \n",
      "\n",
      "as we have moved so far in the direction of being 'brainy' then the two terms in the numerator must be maxed out and that the denominator, the energy cost and brain size would be reduced by improvements in the way the brain is networked in humans. in birds something similar has happened, they get more brains per gram but in their case this is in part a necessity due to the lift capacity of their wings. this has allowed a lower cost for higher intelligence, and so they have become very smart, equivalent in aspects to monkeys, dogs, and human children. \n",
      "\n",
      "we might also wonder why whales would have big brains, given they can't do a lot but swim. but they also have to move huge distances, they can engineer their immediate environment and food intake by choices related to moving, and sharing intelligence. in turn the benefits to them of that create a more secure food supply, so the energy cost is not a significant impediment of having a bigger brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "this ought to be, in very rough form, a universal formula for the evolution of intelligence, but that is just in my view. the relative consumption of resting energy by the brain is probably highest in humans and the tree shrew, and that the percentage of energy used by the brain should be more valuable than the brain to body ratio. having a high brain to body (energy) ratio might not mean you are the cleverest creature out there, but it does suggest that the selective pressure is most strongly shifted to higher intelligence in these animals.\n",

      "\n",
      "**what**  \n",
      "decades ago ufo programs were hidden from oversight. for true disclosure to occur it would mean that those presently in charge would need to come forward and accept the consequences and liabilities of years of governmental deceit. given our built-in desires for self-preservation, this means that full disclosure will likely never happen. therefore, providing amnesty for those in these rogue ufo organizations may be the only way to get genuine governmental level disclosure. amnesty does not guarantee public disclosure, but it does seek to ensure that those in government who should be informed to make these decisions are informed. an amnesty solution retains full confidentiality of people and data. it is up to the appropriate governmental bodies to decide what can and should be released to the public. to help make this amnesty-driven disclosure a reality the #ufoamnesty project aims to create political and public discourse on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**why**\n",
      "\n",
      "currently, a major issue is that the public interest is fleeting. when these short bursts of interest occur the public’s energy and interest is not meaningfully utilized. most people get started in this topic very interested, they then do nothing and mentally put the ufo topic away until the next news comes along. for the large majority of the public this cycle of excitement with new news and then no action repeats itself. this means that most of the public's interest is never developed or used. those who could be activated for more action to help disclosure progression never end up contributing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**how**\n",
      "\n",
      "the #ufoamnesty project aims to galvanize and activate the public interest through meaningful, viral campaigns with clear objectives and call to actions. this starts from creating a credible apolitical project that the general public can participate in without cost, and while minimizing social stigma.\n",
      "\n",
      "as this push for ufo amnesty should be apolitical, (as it does support any one party, agenda, individual or group) it should be a mission where even the likes of steven greer and lue elizondo can give joint support. this should mean we can unify all parts of the ufo community, and more importantly the wider general public, under one mission that drives mass public actions in support of amnesty for rogue ufo programs.\n",

      "**1. viral social media &amp; physical marketing campaigns:**\n",

      "* think of campaigns like [#blackouttuesday](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8d8n/the-blackouttuesday-instagram-meme-is-silencing-black-voices)\n",

      "* using viral campaigns we achieve mass awareness and mass action (via clear cta’s in campaigns)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. effective use of existing public interest:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **free influencers:** many celebrities/influencers will give free campaign exposure if used correctly. from the likes of demi lovato to julius dein (facebook’s most-watched page), these celebrities have a genuine interest in ufo’s that we can capture to support campaigns for free - granting us billions in views and reach for free.\n",
      "* **mass public action:** galavazing interest under singular mass public campaigns internationally. these could be political petitions, to media pitching or emails/letters to politicians. this also includes creating an easy-to-share an archive of links that include links to existing articles, interviews, videos and more to share with friends and family to make it easier for organic virality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. effective use of all media types:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **creating discourse regarding ufo technologies ability to solve climate &amp; energy issues**  \n",
      "\n",
      "   * this is a topic not yet discussed which can activate eco-conscious activism &amp; new people\n",
      "   * increasing this awareness is a whole new way to reach a whole new segment of the public\n",
      "   * we should also do this using partnership with organizations from the dicaprio foundation to secure the likes of sustainability icons such as david attenborough &amp; greta thunberg\n",
      "   * pitching to eco journalists and those in climate science will also help secure coverage\n",
      "* **new media:** youtube channels, podcasts, tiktok, meme pages, influencers\n",
      "* **traditional media:** tv news, newspapers, magazines\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#8203;\n",
      "\n",
      "    tactics:  \n",
      "\n",
      "**free marketing seeding**\n",
      "\n",
      "to seed campaigns, we should be using existing ufo interest groups first. initially, we can consider these across 3 major groups, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **the hyper engaged community:**  \n",
      "***definition:*** these are the people who read ufo subreddits and are on ufo twitter every day to read up on and potentially engage online in the topic. these people do intentional check-ins frequently on the subject. (estimated 1%-5% of the ufo community)  \n",
      "***use:*** these are the people we can rely on for free initial grass-roots pushes, and potentially physical marketing. this includes for example mass pitching for coverage to journalists, news sites/social pages, tv shows, radio and vloggers. these groups eill also help with physical campaigns, for example - college campuses activation to activate gen z student activism.\n",
      "2. **the disengaged community:**  \n",
      "***definition:*** these are people who were very interested initially, but through years of disappointment have become less engaged but are still interested in updates. with appropriate engagement, these can become members of the hyper engaged community (estimated 50-75% of the ufo community)  \n",
      "***use:*** these are the people we must update and re-energize. this should start with easy, low commitment things like viewing, liking and sharing. they should then gradually be funneled to more high level participation activities like signing petitions, posting on own socials etc\n",
      "3. **the interested celebrities &amp; influencers**  \n",
      "***definition:*** these are the public figures who have a genuine interest in the topic and so will offer free support if approached and activated correctly. this includes celebrities like demi lovato, leonardo dicaprio and post malone. this also includes digital celebrities/influencers, like large viral tiktokers and ig/fb influencers in all niches, from logan paul, to faze clan and joe rogan.  \n",
      "***use:*** these are the people who will help us achieve free distribution to billions globally. to activate these they will be included in things like panel livestream ama’s and pre-seeding campaigns if we do things like 1 day lead up viral events.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#8203;\n",
      "\n",
      "    markerting campaign #1: occupy 1 day globally  \n",
      "\n",
      "whether it be one of world's first viral activism campaigns like kony 2012, or the more recent [#blackouttuesday](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8d8n/the-blackouttuesday-instagram-meme-is-silencing-black-voices) campaign, it’s clear that focusing public energy to 1-day can greatly increase the odds of participation. this can be explained in 2 main reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **with everyone posting the same thing at once it becomes socially acceptable to do so.**  \n",
      "for a regular campaign it’s hard anyway to get mass public engagement. most people feel insecure about posting; worrying they won’t get likes or they’ll be judged for the opinion. make it a ufo topic and it’s even harder due to the stigma. therefore, having a day to activate everyone at once will greatly help people feel more comfortable in posting as they aren’t doing this alone at a random time. instead they do it with thousands of others and well respected public figures.\n",
      "2. **with everyone sharing at once it socially guilts you to not be involved - if the barrier to be involved is as simple as a story share or signing of online petition and reposting the confirmation page.** people follow other people. if all your friends are posting on social media about a social justice campaign and you don’t - you’re the odd one one out who doesn’t care. therefore, having one day where anyone can easily join with a few taps will increase the odds of success.\n",
      "3. **hype - the build up to the day, the excitement of being part of a movement together**\n",
      "4. **belief in the possibility of effecting change through participation**\n",
      "\n",
      "if #ufoamnesty uses the 1 day approach these would be some considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **assets:** video and image assets must be prepped and provided for distribution to the community and optimized for each social. ideally we should have 1 hero video posted everywhere that has a montage of the most credible media and ends with a clear cta at the end. for example, this could start off with the flir footage, have cuts of reputable news stories quotes, articles and government personnel interviews internationally.  \n",
      "the primary cta at the end of this video should be to repost/retweet at the most basic level.  \n",
      "the deeper level of cta’s should be to sign petitions, and to attend the next day's livestream ama where the global public has a chance to ask questions to the likes of lue (if he’s on board with this), and other governmental advisors. ideally we can use the day's hype to also encourage the world to join the next day on a livestream ama with ideally the likes of luis e, christopher m, and other international government personnel who are comfortable being open about the ufo subject and are vetted, credible official personnel.\n",
      "2. **clear cta’s:** aside from asking for posting and retweeting of media, the campaign must also have different levels of engagement for more the different levels of motivated public participants. for example, pre-written tweets to tweet local government representatives, to petition signatures. some public participants will want to help as much as they can, whereas others will simply want to reshare online and not do more than that. for this reason we need to ensure we have 1 core cta, but also secondary and tertiary cta’s for those who want to help in as many ways as possible.\n",
      "3. **launch day strategy:** while the campaign should aim to build hype for maximum participation on the day of the campaign, we must also ensure we have strategies to find and capture those whose interest is sparked the most who can become part of “the hyper engaged community”. for these people we must have active efforts to engage with those engaging in the campaign on the day. we must also have appropriate “nets” to identify and retain communication with these people for future pushes. this can be with email or phone sign ups, to follows on campaigns socials.\n",
      "4. **ongoing campaigns:** there must be a developed strategy to appropriately capture the hype built on the day, and on the next day's livestream ama. this should be done in mind to decide how best to maximize the hype and build the community for future campaigns.\n",
      "5. **recruitment -** we are only as good as the team. with this in mind, both during the campaign and ongoing we need to focus on recruitment as this is when hype will peak. whether these are marketeers, scientists, politicians, teachers, students - whatever. we need a systematized way people can apply to volunteer help, then a method to meaningfully use all of this help and direct this activity.\n",

      "\n",
      "&gt;but to find where we split from the octopus, we have to travel much further down the (animal evolution tree) branches to arround 600 million years ago. (...) as the evolutionary tree branched and divirged, intelligence blossomed on our branch of vertebrates, **and totally seperately, in the cephalopds.** and, with the cephalopods evolving before any of the intelligent vertebrates, it's likely that they where the fisrt intelligent animals that appeared on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "the video proceeds to explain how complex it's the octpus intelligence, the neurons spread on their whole \"body\" and not only in a brain, the crazy abilitties it has, realted to chemichal reaction, cammouflage and etc. it also says this when comparing with mammals:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;the octopus is a solitary creature. it has no social bonds, no social hierarchy. it makes us rethink the evolutionary reasons for play. in fact, much of our idea of intelligence is based on the idea that it evolved out of a social need. (...) \"you see, our big problem with knowing the development of intelligence is that we know it from mammals, from the primates, our relatives. so we know that this particular set of conditions sets up for being intelligent. but then we have another model, the octopus.\" -dr. jennifer mather, professor at the university of lethbridge and octopus resercher.\n",
      "\n",
      "the video ends by telling how the story of the modern octopus, they came from the \"massive, armored cephalopods\" who dominated the ordovician period, 360 million years ago. their kingdom where stopped by: the first mass extinction of life on earth!\n",
      "\n",
      "the [evolution of cephalopds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution_of_cephalopods) dates back to deep sea. where i'm going with that? well think about the possibilities. what if the invertebrates with neurons spread over their bodies kept developing intelligence over the millions of years? trying to think very outside the box, what if life also developed a very different path from ours right in our own earth, how confusing, different and exotic this other form of life could be, to the point where we wouldn't even undersand it. in my own wonders, i think how would a species like that interact with it's own envirionment, **how the pressure would affect their movement,** how technology could be developed, how would a different form of intelligence approach physics, harvest [eletromagnetic energy from volcanos](https://schmidtocean.org/cruise/magnetic-anomalies-at-the-worlds-largest-volcano/) and [use magma](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/science/axial-volcano-mapping.html) to travel through them?\n",

i was literally losing my mind trying to upload to facebook or youtube... someone had to see this, i had to share it with the world.... something was preventing me from doing that.... soooooo.... i get out my iphone 6s + that i've just kept around as a back up and spare phone, and i record the recordings that are on the iphone 11 because it was like they were locked... all i was able to do with those files at the end of it all was delete them from my phone....so here i am re-recording every single video i took, just recording another recording, literally.....after i am all done i watch each video again just to make sure i didn't mess anything up or miss one and so forth.... this is when the voice reveals itself... it was there the whole time but i never heard it in real time/real life/while originally filming.... it was always there in my original recording but somehow masked... maybe whatever it was, and you will hear it, somehow is what created the lock on my phone that disabled me from taking them off my phone... i swear to god or to whatever the highest possible spiritual being/our creator is that i am not making this up, these videos are un-edited, 100% this is genuine..... ok - so back to the other videos, which ones and where to start and what to look for.... find video img\\_0034 - start at about 20 seconds, img\\_0036, start around 30 seconds, img\\_0036 watch again in slow motion if possible, from 30 seconds up until 2:40 mark, and you can see what i am about to describe..... so i don't even know where to begin with this one, but it definitely had something to do with the activity that i am so upset i did not capture the night before.... there was one ufo that appeared to have either landed on the island in the middle of the lake or at least come very close to it... then shooting stars started coming down, not like in troves, but one here, one there, spaced out by several minutes each.... but they all appeared to land on the island... so since i didn't capture any of this, i can only imagine what they were doing... however, whatever they dropped off on that island, in the morning it began to materialize and nano-bots were literally swimming in the water in groups that appeared to be bubbles but you will clearly see that is not the case in my videos.... these nano-bot aquatic \"things\" literally form some type of chain like network in the water right in front of my eyes, and on camera... i look to the left to check some bubbles approaching, look to the right again and the chain has already expanded 10x, look back to the left and same thing.... this network surrounded the entire lake... the network chain eventually was just all linked together at the shoreline... the weird thing is also, the very next day i went back again and i went early i even brought my fishing gear with me in case i saw these things again i was going to try and snag a piece of it to see what it was.... but it was gone.... it was like the day before never even happened.... \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_again, the network/chain/nano-creatures/etc videos to look for are: img\\_0034 - start at about 20 seconds, img\\_0036, start around 30 seconds, img\\_0036 watch again in slow motion if possible, from 30 seconds up until 2:40 mark, and you can see what i am about to describe..... and one more time the videos with the reptilian voice: img\\_0029 - start at 30 second mark, put speakers or headphones on the loudest setting they go and listen to the reptilian literally speaking to me... next find img\\_0030, start at 25 seconds in and do the same thing and listen for the same thing... next find img\\_0031 and start at 10 seconds in and same again....\n",

      "looking at long term goals (deep space exploration) i no longer sense that the human species is properly organized yet, to productively continue building rocket powered space ships for the purposes of expanding to a mars colony vision. the cost/value of productive use of rocket fuel powered ships even in their efforts to reduce space transportation costs is too far off of the spectrum from integrating inter-species alliances to continue their production. in essence we need to readdress the vehicles we are designing entirely. \n",

      "i‘ve been asking myself that for quite some time now. when i say space warfare, i’m refering to multiple parties separated by space, like two planetary colonies fighting. obviously it would be a very slow and long ranged endeavor. i have multiple scenarios i’d like your opinion on. 1. interplanetary warfare. i think this is probably the easiest, but also most destructive way to fight. just launch a rod of metal at another planet fast enough and you have essentially a nuke. how could you be able to protect yourself from this kind of thing? perhaps something like a missile defense system? idk i‘d like your opinions on that. 2. fighting in space assuming you managed to protect yourself from just plain missiles or you actually plan to send down a land invasion force, you would probably have to engage in space. i imagine something similar to submarines fighting, with additional predicaments like heat management. also how would you track an enemy spaceship and how would you try to hide yourself? what do you guys think of this. and finally 3.conquering a planet. what would be the best way to land ground troups on a planet? you could consider dropping „planes“ carrying the troups into orbit? i‘d love some responses.\n"

    "'Men In Black (MIB) is a government entity that researches & monitors the sentiment of people on aliens, whether conspiracies that are made are a little too close to things that the people should not know about. They are requesting us, the Reddit Data Science team to create a model to classify reddit posts and identify the key words that differentiates the post from \"Aliens\" to \"Space\". This would facilitate MIB's intelligence collection efforts about sentiments from ordinary citizens. This information can also be useful for other associations to promote its marketing effort on social media, events and podcasts, that in turn can feed information to the mainstream.<br><br>\n",
    "All the models trained were able to classify the posts accurately, with a F1 score between 89% to 91% and an AUC of 96% to 97%, but we chose Tfidf vectorizer and Logistic Regression model as it is easier to interpret. The model makes its predictions by using the coefficients of each word in the post and calculates the odds of it belonging to alien subreddit or it not belonging to alien subreddit.<br><br>\n",
    "The top words with the highest 'weights' for alien subreddit are:\n",
    "- alien\n",
    "- ufo\n",
    "- specie(s)\n",
    "- human\n",
    "- extraterrestrial\n",
    "- disclosure\n",
    "- being\n",
    "- story\n",
    "- people\n",
    "- may <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The more the above listed words appear in a post, the higher the chance if it belonging to alien subreddit. <br><br>"

Misclassification seems to occur when the post is made up of ambiguous words ( words with coefficients close to 0 ) and 1 or 2 words with strong correlation ( words with high absolute coefficients )."
