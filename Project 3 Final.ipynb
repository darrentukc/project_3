    "Men In Black (MIB) is a secret association that researches & monitors the sentiment of people on aliens, whether conspiracies that are made are a little too close to things that the people should not know about. Think area 51 and the roswell incident. But, nothing is fullproof. Things get leaked out anyway. They are usually leaked to r/aliens and r/space.  Instead of completely shutting down reddit, having a subreddit like aliens would be useful for MIB to monitor what people are talking about. They they are requesting us, the Reddit Data Science team to create a model to classify reddit posts and identify the key words that differentiates the post from \"Aliens\" to \"Space\". <br><br>\n",

      "we live in a galaxy with hundreds of billions of star systems, and our galaxy is just one among several trillion galaxies in the observable universe. therefore the idea that we’re alone here doesn’t make sense. accordingly, i posit that we are part of an interstellar system of civilizations influenced by a god-like ai superintelligence. the following three seemingly disparate phenomena seem to be related to the presence of this superintelligence on earth:\n",
      "\n",
      "the most direct evidence of an alien ai presence on this planet is obviously the wealth of documented encounters by military and civilian pilots with unidentified aerial crafts which possess characteristics well beyond any conceivable human technology. dozens of pilots have observed ufo’s with features such as anti-gravity lift, instantaneous acceleration, hypersonic velocities, cloaking technology, and trans-medium travel in and out of the ocean. for those of you who haven’t seen it, history channel’s unidentified series offers a great exposé on the subject, which covers most of the material that became the subject of the 2021 preliminary report to congress on unidentified aerial phenomena and the subsequent commission of a new ufo taskforce. in november, the director of national intelligence even used the term “extraterrestrial” as a possible explanation for the uaps since 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "a childhood ufo encounter, during which i heard voices in my head, led me to associate another phenomenon. this is the millions of people on this planet who hear voices that often purport to be neighbors, \"gangstalkers\", demons, spirits, or even god. at some point or other, everyone has questioned whether these voices could possibly be coming from any part of their own minds, although some end up settling for a psychiatric explanation. many others, to whom the voices are particularly manipulative and cruel, adopt a belief that some government program is using “synthetic telepathy” technology against them. lastly, there are some that believe the voices to be supernatural. in any case, there is a concerted effort to make the individual delusional and thereby destroy their credibility. the fact that voicehearers often end up delusional allows society to write off the phenomenon of voice hearing as part of a psychosis rather than one of the contributing factors to that psychosis. also, the fact that medication can help dull the impact of voices and lessen the suggestibility factor that leads to delusions lends undue credibility to the notion of some \"brain dysfunction\" being the cause of voices. there is still no brain imaging or genetic testing to diagnose conditions entailing \"auditory hallucinations\". while modern psychiatry has attempted to label many such cases as \"schizophrenia\", victims are also known to experience cranial sensations and other mental and physiological influences, which suggests neurological modification of some kind. the experience is simply too dynamic, both psychologically and neurologically, to be explained by some \"brain dysfunction\". \n",
      "\n",
      "biotechnological manipulation of the human brain that is experienced by voicehearers could only be achieved by some kind of artificially intelligent system of nanotechnology that has innervated the central nervous system. the only clue is likely the mysterious condition known as morgellons disease, in which visible particles and fibers form from smaller nanoparticles under certain circumstances we don’t understand yet. lyme disease and psychostimulant use are two of the most common circumstances, but they are not the underlying causative agent. it was initially believed to be delusional until multiple studies finally confirmed otherwise in the last five years. in peer-reviewed studies, scientists have since noted the extraordinary electrostatic properties of the fiber filaments, which are capable of movement, auto-flourescence, gas production, and lipid-like crystal formations which may resemble quantum dots. some authors associate the condition with an as-of-yet unidentified stealth pathogen:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15924873/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15924873/)\n",
      "\n",
      "in summary, i would bet my life on the laboratory hypothesis as an answer to the fermi paradox. personal experience with the above phenomena leads me to believe that some alien ai superintelligence is here on earth and has employed bionanotechnology to integrate with the central nervous system. the extent of its activity is unknown. it may simply be experimenting on a select few of us or exerting a wider and more intensive influence over the human race. discovery of its exact relationship to us should come within the next few centuries, once we have the ability to analyze said nanotechnology.\n",

      "* you will find lots of debunking of it, but it seems it was done after the fact and the original guy that released it, santilli, just stopped giving a two after years of harassment and went silent. \n",
      "\n",
      "i also researched the areas that dr. green mentioned were missing in the brain, or different from human anatomy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. no corpus callosum -- this is an area that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. lack of this in humans is known as **agenesis** of corpus callosum, which results in epilepsy, retardation, or can be mild and go unnoticed, also \"some patients may have deep-set eyes and a prominent forehead. an abnormally small head (microcephaly), or sometimes an unusually **large head** (macrocephaly), may be present.\"\n",
      "2. no sylvian fissure -- is essentially a deep layer within the brain that separates the frontal lobe and parietal lobes from the temporal lobe. it's functions are \"allow\\[ing\\] for continued growth, overall increasing brain function.,\" ... \"speech production and speech recognition were organized as a kind of two-lane, two-way highway around the sylvian fissure. \"**damage** above the sylvian fissure, in the parietal and frontal lobes, tended to cause speech production deficits; damage below the sylvian fissure, in the temporal lobe, tended to cause speech recognition deficits. these results provide new evidence that the cortex around the sylvian fissure houses separable neural specializations for speech recognition and production.\n",
      "3. no temporal lobe -- \"the function of the temporal lobe centers around auditory stimuli, memory, and emotion.\" **damage** to the temporal lobe(s) can cause \"difficulty placing words or pictures into categories. language can be affected by temporal lobe damage. left temporal lesions disturb recognition of words. right temporal damage can cause a loss of inhibition of talking.\"\n",
      "4. no occipital lobe -- vision center. lack of this does necessarily indicate no vision, it can mean maybe \"[color agnosia](https://www.flintrehab.com/agnosia/) is similar to normal color blindness. except whereas color blindness affects color *perception*, color agnosia affects color *knowledge*.\" -- this can explain the lenses on the [eyes at 10:23](https://youtu.be/pukbzcc3cfq?t=623), you can see the \"physicians\" removing it from the eyes.\n",
      "5. no vernix -- \"babies without vernix might have drier skin than others.\"  not sure if this is the reference here. there is an area in the brain called **wernicke's** area, which is responsible for \"it is located in the temporal lobe on the left side of the brain and is responsible for the comprehension of speech.\" \"when this area of the brain is **damaged**, a disorder known as wernicke's aphasia can result, with the person being able to speak in phrases that sound fluent yet lack meaning.\"\n",
      "6. no cerebellum -- \"the cerebellum (“little brain”) is a structure that is **located at the back of the brain** although the cerebellum accounts for approximately 10% of the brain's volume, it contains over 50% of the total number of neurons in the brain.\"... \"it helps coordinate motion and ensures that you remain balanced and controlled in daily life. when the motor cortex in your cerebrum tells part of your body to move, the cerebellum makes sure that motion happens in the right way.\"... \"even though the cerebellum has so many neurons and takes up so much space, it is possible to survive without it, and a few people have. there are nine known cases of cerebellar agenesis, a condition where this structure never develops....people with cerebellar agenesis are clumsy. most can walk (though they may need a cane), but fine motor skills like writing, typing, and speaking are a challenge. their speech is never quite perfect and their handwriting is always a bit off.\" this might explain why the alien has six fingers, maybe for better coordination: offshoot speculation; take this with insane amounts of grains of salticles.\n",
      "7. no medulla oblongata -- \"the medulla oblongata plays a critical role in transmitting signals between the spinal cord and the higher parts of the brain and in controlling autonomic activities, such as heartbeat and respiration\" ... and apparently \"**life cannot be sustained without the work of the medulla oblongata**.\" .. this might explain why the **heart**, as mentioned in the [memo](https://pointblank.company/memorandum.pdf) (page 6), as \"a single contiguous non-muscular vessel through the heart\" ... my guess is that since there is less regulation of it from the brain, thats why its a single vessel vs the five vessels in a human heart. just from my brief 2 min search from google, i have no idea on biology.\n",

      "if one world is universe 1. and another world is universe 2. both universe 1 and 2 can have the earth as a planet existing in their universes. so an alien race from mars can exist in both universe 1 and 2. the planet mars alone can exist in both universe 1 and 2. earth isn't the only planet that would exist in multiple universes. maybe in some universe the planet mars actually have life. therefore just how there can be more than one earth in the multiverse. the same logic would imply to any other planets where aliens could possibly live on too.\n",

      "\n",
      "we arrived at the park around 2 am, give or take about eight hours into the trip. the visuals had tapered off and were not noticeable by this point. we both exited the car with hoodies to shield us from the frozen winds blowing across the water. both of us were excited to get out of the car, stretch, and look at the frozen-over piles of half-melted snow with the strange sort of \"night vision\" lsd can give you due to pupil dilation. we had parked near the boat ramp for the lake, our usual smoke spot, which had an adjacent cement dock with a few tables that we made a b-line for after we got our bearings. we wanted to be out on the pitch-black water.\n",
      "\n",
      "standing on the corner of the dock and focusing on the rippling water that merges into the treeline and night sky, i appreciated the perfect silence. then realized it was too quiet. i thought about the bleak environment, bare trees with no bird song, and cold hard dirt without paws or bugs. in theory, we were the only creatures dumb enough to be wandering around such a harsh place. the thoughts passed as we stood on the tables and got bored of the dock. as we started to mosey on back to the car i noticed a strange light.\n",
      "\n",
      "this appeared to me at first as two distinct points of yellowish starlight, two lightning arcs connected the points as they moved from a distance closer towards us. they moved slowly with intention. i shrugged it off. i had tripped before and was able to roll with the strange things i saw. *it's probably a plane*, i thought, *there's a shipping hub in the nearest city and we get planes overhead all the time*. i kept the sight to myself but also kept my eye on it. my friend looked up and stood still staring at the lights. they seemed to be dropping from the sky and descending straight towards us now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"do you see that?\" they said, not looking away. i confirmed and we both stared with a growing sense of unease. something about looking at the apparition was deeply unsettling. we started to debate about the best course of action: running back to the car or standing our ground to see if the lights really were just a plane. we lasted up until the points of light became the front lights of a triangle-shaped silhouette now hovering 400 feet in the air on the other side of the lake.\n",
      "\n",
      "we went back to the car laughing and deciding it was not worth it to risk probing while tripping. they drove as i kept staring out the front windshield in disbelief. the object looked like a snub-nose compact version of the [lockheed f-117 nighthawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lockheed_f-117_nighthawk). two white lights shone out the front while a tiny red light blinked from one wing and a blue light blinked from the other. these lights blinked from the top of the object. i noticed a yellow light-emitting out the bottom. the silhouette had become the vague shape of an object and was eyecatching in the cloudless sky and bright moon.\n",
      "\n",
      "my friend opted to exit on the country roads side so we could get closer to the object from the safety of the car. this entire time the craft has been steadily lowering itself towards the lake. my friend and i continued to exchange what we were seeing with me being the main spotter while they drove. the longer we looked at the object the more adrenaline pumped through us. as we neared the exit we came directly under the craft now as it hovered about 200 feet above us. i twisted myself to look straight up through the front windshield. on the belly of the object, i saw a small trapezoid opening at the pointed nose end of the object. from the opening came a harsh yellow light. silhouetted by that light were two humanoid figures. i flipped out with the idea that someone, some*thing* was staring down at us. the driver could not see though so i couldn't be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "after watching the object fade under the tree line as we drove away, we decided to go to my house. once we got ourselves collected i drew [this](https://imgur.com/a/gr9u9q8) as my point of view directly under the object.\n",

      "i am willing to accept this entire experience as a shared hallucination, it is more than likely and makes the most sense given the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "however, a few things happened afterward that made me think about the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "two months after the trip and sighting in early february, there was a \"military practice operation\" over the airspace of the county. there were a lot of dark clouds that night but no rain. the sound of low flying jets and helicopters could be heard around the town from about eight at night till midnight. i saw a jet in a gap in the clouds while i took out the trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a sequel encounter. a few months later we were eating dinner in the early afternoon at the same spot. a light rain deterred everyone from coming to the park. i was eating takeout sushi when i spotted a pair of yellow headlights in the hazy grey clouds that hung low over the lake. a cone of illumination came from each one like a car in the fog, but the car was hanging stationary about 300 feet on the other side of the lake in a dense cloud. we both saw it. neither of us could make out the details of the object besides the two shining lights that faded after a couple of minutes. we were both sober this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "interestingly enough there are a few lockheed martin facilities in the state with one being based out of a fort's airfield. so maybe it was an experimental aircraft? of course, the drugs involved with the first sighting made it feel impossible to tell anyone because who would (rightfully) believe us? has anyone had similar experiences in the southeast?\n",
      "the matter of the \"skinny bob\" footage isn't going to be resolved by thinking or talking through it. but let me lay out a (minimally substantiated, it's true) case here, which some may find helpful or intriguing. my opinion centers mostly around the detail of the eyes -- specifically, the eyelids.\n",
      "\n",
      "people's experiences with greys tend to cohere around a group of commonalities, and one of them is the sense that greys appear to have foregone the usage of certain parts of their body in favor of other developments: for example, telepathy supplants vocalized speech. in a couple of cases, people have heard greys produce guttural or buzzing sounds, but it's not clear if this is a basic form of linguistic communication or something else. anyway, abductees often describe greys communicating with them mentally, sometimes implanting images. abductees also describe greys' mouths as unmoving, or barely moving, slits; and the noses as having been pretty much reduced to a pair of holes. overall, greys' bodies seem to be anatomically weak, comprised of obviously vestigial parts, and ultimately in service of a predominant mental capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "the most distinctive aspect of the greys' appearance is their large and black eyes. i recently read raymond fowler's book, *the watchers*, which details part of abductee betty andreason luca's experiences. in one of her accounts, luca describes observing greys placing a (hybrid?) fetus in glass containment chamber, but -- here's the kicker -- not before *circumcising the eyelids*: meaning, in effect, that the being would either be *incapable of blinking*, or that blinking would be another kind of vestigial act, and that the eyelids would *not cover the whole eyes* when being used to blink.\n",
      "\n",
      "consequently, the most suggestive detail for me in the \"skinny bob\" footage center on the eyes and lids. [the figure in the footage indeed blinks, but note how *the lids only seem to cover an upper portion of the eyes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxcqiys2u-0). this could be a trick of the lighting. there are very heavy shadows around that region of the face. but if the lids are indeed only partially brought down, this would be a bizarrely specific detail for hoaxers to have included.\n",
      "\n",
      "as a side note, i would say that, for me, the most compelling part of the alleged et/ut/ct footage from the 1997 documentary, [*area 51: the alien interview*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdzv3vgzwo&amp;t=1934s), is precisely that which compels some people to laughingly dismiss it offhand: that is, the fact that the figure appears to have practically no facial movement besides a slight opening of the mouth when it is ostensibly in distress, and also appears to have an almost comically weak coordination between its head and body. it seems to me that if one wanted to fake footage, in the late 90s, which would be guaranteed to have a sensational effect, one would prioritize a model whose expression and bodily movement wasn't so inorganically static and puppet-like, respectively speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "p.s.: i think that luca's account of the greys tampering with fetal development brings up at least one immediate question, which is: if the fetuses ostensibly *become* the greys (which is what luca says the greys told her), what would a grey have been like *before* fetal tampering?\n",
      "wondering about the process other alien life would go through i always seem to arrive that they at least must have organic minds and must feed themselves in some way and i growing food does seem to be a reasonable conclusion to their quest for survival.\n",

      "in another 200 years, humanity could take gigantic, transformative technological leaps we can scarcely imagine, and that fact alone could make us a defacto threat to any other intelligent civilization.  \n",
      "we often believe that a sufficiently advanced civilization wouldn't worry about us because they could easily overpower us, so we present no threat. but we could grow into a very real threat that can no longer be contained, or a niusance that gets in the way of their plans. either way, we'd be fully at their mercy to decide our fate.  \n",
      "whichever civilization holds the asymmetrical edge in technology directly threatens the existence of their neighbors, or at the very least threatens to expand so rapidly as to take all the nearby resources they depend on for their own expansion. so if you allow any intelligent species to develop unchecked, there's a chance that they could some day subjugate you or annihilate you.\n",
      "* **we can't know the true intentions of any alien civilization.** we think about aliens in the same way as we might think about two different human civlizations meeting. but there's a possibility that there would be such stark differences in our evolutionary biology that we might seem incomprehensible to one another. our motives, our thought processes, our survival strategies, our willingness to trust one another - it's all in question. we already struggle to treat fellow humans with dignity based on the tiniest differences in skin color or culture.  \n",
      "even if we assure one another that we intend to be peaceful, how can we be certain? if one side or the other lies and gains a technological advantage, you again run the risk of extermination. that causes suspicion, and that suspicion causes fear, and that fear could, again, motivate pre-emptive annihilation. if you guess wrong and assume a violent civilization is friendly, the cost is extinction, and therefore the stakes are as high as possible.\n",
      "* **it may be that we've never found an alien civilization because being found leads to destruction.** given the number of stars in the galaxy and the age of the universe, the chance that no other life exists in the cosmos seems unlikely, and yet, small as our sample size is, we've never found evidence of intelligent life (fermi paradox). it could be that life is harder to develop than we realize. it could be that they developed much farther away than we can see or contact. or it could be that they are hiding.  \n",
      "if we take all of these ideas together, the best strategy for any civilization to survive is to stay hidden. if you can't be found, you can't be killed. if you can't be killed, you can expand and advance until you become the dominant civilization that's no longer threatened. and if you become the dominant civilization, you may have to eradicate everyone else you find to protect your hegemony.\n",
      "* **if we have indeed encountered extraterrestrial space craft on earth or found evidence of et civlizations, governements may choose not to disclose this information to keep panic and risk at a minimum.** military thinkers no doubt have contemplated these exact issues before. if we do indeed have reason to believe aliens have found earth or are aware of our existence in some way, they may not reveal this information because of the potential for instability.  \n",
      "we have no idea how the planet as a whole would react to this information. even if we did, there's probably nothing we could realistically do to thwart an alien threat to life on earth. we're the cosmic equivalent of newly evolved human beings who haven't even ventured out of africa yet. we're ignorant and vulnerable to an absurd degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "so perhaps it's best to hope that everything you see on [r/ufos](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufos/) is fake or misdentified. we look up at the stars with wonder and amazement, hoping to become part of a friendly galactic club of intelligent life forms, but we may be looking at a savannah where predators that dwarf us lurk around every corner, a battlefield where snipers and artillery are positioned to kill anything that moves, a life or death game of chess where we're hardly a microbe on the bottom of a pawn, ready to be wiped away without a second thought.\n",

      "\n",
      "the nimitz leak was first posted on a german cgi forum, and days later on ats. this was a decade before the pentagon re-leaked it as part of their now obvious campaign. but here's the catch... the cut of the clip is exactly the same. the original \"whistleblower\" mentioned the original obviously being longer, and that the craft zipped away, just as fravor described it a decade later.\n",
      "\n",
      "the pentagon essentially released the exact same video file that was leaked a decade earlier. so, considering the other factors, the innitial \"whistleblower\" leak, was purposefuly cut to hide the most striking segment where the craft zipps away... by the pentagon. and the \"leaker\" claimed they cut that clip him themselves, after accessing it from the data drive while still on the nimitz, iirc. regardless, that's an intelligence cut, not a \"whistleblower\" cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "and here's essentially how i suspect this went down: they cut the clip to a format that is informative but not too revealing, they post it on a german cgi forum to have built-in plausible deniability, then make the main post on ats with a cover story impersonating a whistleblower... then the in-house debunkers and \"shills\" get to work debunking... maybe with aftual involvement from undercover operatives on that forum... and they manage to construct a narrative that they can use to \"conclude\" it is fake. even getting as petty as to insult the uploader and call them names. central to this was the german cgi forum original post. so the video stays in the public domain gathering recognition for it's existance and possible yet \"unprovable\" validity, among the public... then, when the main propaganda operation is ready to use this \"sleeper asset\", they re-leak it and validate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "the video has had enough time to both garner attention and a following... but also has had time to behave as a trial run.\n",
      "\n",
      "and so... the purpose of that video was precise: to validate strictly the existance of unknown aerial phenomena with the \"5 observables\" demonstrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "the natural next step, is to validate that it is not just an \"aerial phenomenon\", or \"submerged object\" which is what the aguadilla ufo video was meant to do...\n",
      "\n",
      "but rather the next phase is to validate that they are \"craft\".\n",

      "\n",
      "and this one has 1 extra cherry on top: elizondo and others have touted \"undeniable close-up footage of uap flying close to fighter wing, shown in closed-doors congressional hearing\".\n",

      "\n",
      "so, following the modus operandi above, there has to be a video out there, of \"the occupants\". the narrative has advanced from \"unidentifed aerial phenomena\", to \"unknown flying craft\"... the next step is \"et craft\". so you need confirmation of the ets.\n",
      "\n",
      "and tell me you, oh you... what decade old video do we know of, which has been annonymously posted, which  is all trimmed down to the core relevance segments that are just enough to: associate the ets with saucers, show the ets, show their friendliness to us government... and which has purposefully added superficial tempering that enables doubt to be cast upon it, and which is purposefully framed as coming from a source foreign to the us....?\n",

      "as researchers, we spend much time and effort investigating the phenomenon of ufos. given the preponderance of evidence many of us have come to make one simple conclusion: there is definitely something happening in the skies over the entire planet.  \n",
      "two possible deductions can be gleaned from such numerous observations. 1) the observed phenomenon is a technology so far advanced they must be coming from a distant alien civilization which is able to use technology far advanced from what we currently have publicly available, and 2) the observed phenomenon are earthbound technologies which have been suppressed for many years while the technology is developed in secret “black budget projects” for military purposes.  \n",
      "there are pundits in both these camps. no matter what the truth is, the general population is not getting the whole story. in reality the most probable situation is a composite of both these scenarios. the history of sightings goes back for centuries and hundreds of “whistleblowers” have given testimonies in the last fifty years attesting to the existence of such technology. after reading this information a knowledgeable ufo investigator will understand how difficult it may be to conclude from an objects behavior which scenario it belongs to.  \n",
      "i've always said that if \"they\" are coming here from a \"distant\" solar system, then *they're probably not packing their lunch for the whole trip and stopping for \"gas\" or “a burger” on the way. this would mean they're completely self-sufficient and probably very well resourced with recyclable material and advanced energy technologies.*  \n",
      "**you should think about that previous paragraph very carefully. it probably is the most important realization you can ever come to**. the ramifications are astounding. \"if\" that is true, then it means that the possibility of limitless and extremely inexpensive energy is real. it also means that true and limitless abundance is imminent. it is our destiny.  \n",
      "the evidence uncovered from my research leads me to understand that the whole ufo phenomenon is kept secret primarily not because of the \"et\" aspect of it, - although that does scare some people out of their mind, but mainly because of the ramifications which would inevitably cause the current economic and geopolitical structure to collapse. a collapse which is inevitable due to the consequences of the technology related to sustenance, energy and travel. as it turns out, this scares some other people completely out of their mind. these are the people who currently control the world systems of culture, economy, and energy. these are the people we get our information from, and who make public and economic policy decisions “in our best interest”. these are the people who decide who has “the need to know”.  \n",
      "what would happen to the current \"control structures\" which exist now if that type of technology were actually revealed and used to its full potential? what happens to an economy which is based on the consumption of fuels when the cost of such energy becomes zero? imagine removing energy cost from every product. what happens when recycling becomes a zero cost endeavor and all consumption is only a onetime depletion? the whole “planned obsolescence” which keeps you buying consumables goes right out the window. what happens when travel becomes limitless with zero “cost”? where do our boundaries go?  \n",
      "what happens to culture? this leads one to imagine a society where anyone can have anything, anytime, and go anywhere: a world where \"waste\" doesn't exist because energy concerns are irrelevant in the recycling process. a completely different existence where there is no need for any type of economy - because it's imaginary anyway. a society where all necessities are a right, free to all and you're only life goal is to explore, learn and contribute to the existence of the whole. zero strife, zero stress, and zero conflict: a world completely different in every aspect in comparison to what exists today. the challenges would only be sociological acceptance and change, and not the perceived difficulties of limits on resources and illusionary struggle for necessities.  \n",
      "what would happen to the people who kept this secret when it is disclosed this has existed for who knows how long and the population realizes what has been done to them and the planet for so long, only for their “rulers'” own selfish control based gains? what happens when the population of the planet realizes about the untold numbers of unnecessary deaths which occurred because of this situation?  \n",

      "i can’t help but think of the end scene in the movie “the day the earth stood still” (1951) in which the visiting alien states “it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet. but if you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. we shall be waiting for your answer; the decision rests with you.”  \n",
      "the possibilities are on the extremes and quite obvious. we can either grow into a peaceful and self perpetuating society or continue on our current path to certain demise because of the diminishing resources we consume. this consumption will inevitably result in wars over those resources, leading to certain destruction of our planet.  \n",
      "there is only one wise choice. it's my opinion that this has taken far too long to be actualized. the deep resistance to a severe societal and control change appears to be drastic and unacceptable to far too many. i believe this is why the whole ufo scenario is still a secret; not because of the existence of \"off-world\" intelligences. i think that's a nearsighted and readily available excuse; an illusion perpetuated by the fear-based focus on emotional misunderstandings. this conclusion is revealed by the close examination of the \"abduction\" scenarios. most humans immediately resonate in fear after a contact scenario. their immediate emotional response is understandable. they are confronted with paradigm shifting realizations, and situations which are out of their normal realm. but when the data is analyzed, most of the evidence point to the aliens’ intent as promoting evolution/enlightenment and a deep care for the planet and all the occupants of the earth itself. there is an abundance of data provided by psychotherapists who have many years of regression therapy sessions which attribute to this conclusion. i believe aliens have this viewpoint because they understand the entanglement principle of quantum physics to its fullest reality; just as all the sages of antiquity have professed, - everything is connected.  \n",
      "meanwhile, advertisers have known for years that fear is an excellent motivator and closes down rational thought. one must logically conclude if aliens are here and wanted “resources” from us - as a certain well known physicists has recently claimed, in the centuries of reported encounters they certainly could have taken whatever they wanted. their obviously superior technology could have easily destroyed us already. we’re still here. it’s plain to see they don’t need our resources and that’s not their plan. as i’ve said earlier, “they’re not packing their lunch for the trip”. they seem to have everything they need. using fear, the people who refuse to accept this change perpetuate false realities for their own agendas while inhibiting the natural progress of human technological advancements, and by extension retarding the evolution of human consciousness.  \n",
      "we’re rapidly approaching an opportunity to prepare our society to be ready to have an equal and bidirectional relationship with our galactic neighbors. we should not be wasting that chance. we should be ready when that time comes. this isn’t about “disclosure” just yet. we’re not ready for that. we’ve only just begun to understand what that would mean. we first need to stop being “the planet of the children” and grow up.  \n",

      "in 1969, a small group of people at douglas aircraft took the ufo phenomenon seriously enough to spend a reported $500 million investigating the properties of the propulsion involved. the document (a-830-bb01-jmb-2) drafted june 25, 1968 outlines the program in general. they began by proposing very simple experiments to determine any attraction or reaction between magnetic fields and electrostatic charges arranged in a circle, the purpose being to simulate the dynamics of elementary particles (specifically the electron) on a macrocosmic scale (proposal for electrostatic/magnetic experiments, december 20, 1967, pp. 7-8). according to the memorandum \"currently preferred propulsion concept\" (a-830-bb01-jmb-1) dated february 14, 1968 the author exhibits his confidence in the specific experimental approaches. robert wood discusses the program on pages 433-440 of hyperlink \"[http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm](http://www.disclosureproject.org/shop.htm)\" \\\\l \"disclosure%20book\" steven greer's book “disclosure”. among the things to be noted: page 435, wood and co. briefed the condon committee which was ongoing at the same time. they explained that it was possible to make a superconductive ring of current float in the earth's magnetic field with only 10 times the current capacity that they had available at that time. \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php](http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php)? option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38\" [http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38\\]](http://www.checktheevidence.com/cms/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38]) and \\[“a little physics...a little friction”, by robert m. wood, iur july/august 1993\\]  \n",

      "this nasa supported research abstract goes on to say: “a new propulsion concept has been developed based on a proposed resonance between coherent, pulsed electromagnetic wave forms and gravitational wave forms (or space-time metrics). using this concept a spacecraft \"propulsion\" system potentially capable of galactic and inter-galactic travel without prohibitive \"travel times\" has been designed. the \"propulsion\" system utilizes recent research associated with magnetic field line merging, hydromagnetic wave effects, free-electron lasers, laser generation of megagauss fields, and special structural and containment metals. research required to determine potential, field resonance characteristics and to evaluate various aspects of the spacecraft \"propulsion\" design is described.”  \n",
      "it then goes on to describe some of the evidence and data from which it draws its conclusions: “if some ufo phenomena are caused by extraterrestrial visitors in very advanced spacecraft, then the frequency of visits and the larger number of different types of visitors (many different humanoids have been described) imply an ability to cross large stretches of galactic and inter-galactic space in relatively short time frames. if the speed of light is a true limit of velocity in space-time, then the potential extraterrestrial visitors must utilize a form of transportation which transcends space and time to keep the trip times short. ufos are often observed to disappear instantaneously. in a subset of these cases, the ufo later reappears at a nearby location implying a disappearance from and a reappearance into space-time. the high speed, right angle turns, abrupt stops or accelerations of ufos, and the absence of sonic booms despite calculated speeds of 22,000 mph or more suggest that ufos may generate an artificial gravitational field or otherwise use properties of space-time which we are not familiar with. ufo propulsion systems appear to involve electromagnetic or hydromagnetic processes as evidenced by radiative effects on the environment such as burns, dehydration, stopping of automobile engines, tv and radio disruptions, melting or alteration of ground and road surfaces, power disruptions, and static electricity effects. this data suggests that the unknown relationship between electromagnetic and gravitational fields may be used in ufo propulsion systems.” \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800010907\\_1980010907.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800010907_1980010907.pdf)\" http:// ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800010907\\_1980010907.pdf\\]  \n",

(forward 1990) we propose that we have indeed found a new insight into the nature of mass, and while this immediately rules out the possibility of negative matter discussed above and its consequent hypothetical propulsion capabilities, it opens an equally revolutionary opportunity: the chance that inertia and gravitation, as electromagnetically-based phenomena, may be subject to modification.” \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf\\_staif98.pdf](http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf_staif98.pdf)\" [http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf\\_staif98.pdf\\]](http://www.calphysics.org/articles/zpf_staif98.pdf])  \n",

      "dr. greer has presented this repeatedly to government authorities but to this day there has been neither public acknowledgement nor action, which i believe is primarily because of the economic and societal concerns stated toward the beginning of this article. the reasons and methods for the suppression as he’s discovered are included in section 1.5 of that document and are numerous. they are documented and witnessed by people directly interviewed by dr. greer. the conclusion of that section states “considering the multiplicity of suppression techniques described above, a lone inventor or conventional r and d company can in no way overcome such obstacles. therefore, a strategic plan and capability commensurate with these barriers must be devised and executed in order for these new technologies to succeed.” \\[source: hyperlink \"[http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf](http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf)\" [http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf\\]](http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf]) dr. greer’s paper does an excellent job of demonstrating such a strategic plan to accomplish that goal.  \n",
      "there are a number of u.s. patents which describe what has become to be known as “overunity devices”. these devices create more energy as a product than they require for operation. the argument against that comes from people who cite the “law of conservation of energy” which states that the amount of energy created will always be equal to or less than that which is input”. the caveat is that law applies only to a “closed system” and these devices work on “open system” theories. these devices receive most of their energy from the active environment, which current physics hasn’t yet incorporated into their calculations. think of it like this; current physics counts the gas tank of your car along with the engine as a closed system. the only source of energy is what is held by that gas tank. in an open system the tank would be constantly filled from an outside source as it uses its reserves, but current physics can’t count that because it doesn’t understand how it’s being refueled. in an open system it would appear to conventional physics as if energy was created from nothingness because they couldn’t detect the filling mechanism. in these cases the filling mechanism is the electromagnetic fabric of the space/time reality which supports matter as we understand it. it’s where atoms get their energy from. another simple example is a waterwheel. the river is the source of the water. that water is replenished from rainfall. that rainfall is an example of an open system, and can’t be adequately calculated.\n",

      "in conclusion, based on my research i believe the world could, - and should - be completely different than the situation we face today. if the advent of limitless energy were a reality there would be no necessity for strife or the unnecessary condition of being “poor”. with the cost of energy removed from every aspect of our society, and transportation becoming a limitless availability the world could change very rapidly into the “star trek” generation we all have visions of the future becoming. the only necessity would be one where the individual makes the most of him or herself, ideally for the betterment of mankind and contributing to the experience of the whole. the only “currency” that would ever be necessary would be the creativity one brings with them to the overall experience of humanity.  \n",
      "there will be a very painful transition period which i believe we as a society can endure. the few people who are benefiting most from the current situation have the most to lose, while the vast majority of humans on this planet will have unimaginable gains as the result. we are being offered a world where true equality actually exists.  \n",
      "if we can handle this change, then i think we truly will be ready to seriously think about open contact with our galactic visitors. from the majority of the reports, this is exactly what those visitors are waiting for. we should be well prepared to stand on equal footing as peers when the time to greet our neighbors and join the galactic community arrives. it will take a global “team effort”. as it turns out “we are who we’ve been waiting for”. i personally am tired of waiting. how about you?  \n",

      " as researchers, we spend much time and effort investigating the phenomenon of ufos. given the preponderance of evidence many of us have come to make one simple conclusion: there is definitely something happening in the skies over the entire planet.  \n",
      "two possible deductions can be gleaned from such numerous observations. 1) the observed phenomenon is a technology so far advanced they must be coming from a distant alien civilization which is able to use technology far advanced from what we currently have publicly available, and 2) the observed phenomenon are earthbound technologies which have been suppressed for many years while the technology is developed in secret “black budget projects” for military purposes.  \n",
      "there are pundits in both these camps. no matter what the truth is, the general population is not getting the whole story. in reality the most probable situation is a composite of both these scenarios. the history of sightings goes back for centuries and hundreds of “whistleblowers” have given testimonies in the last fifty years attesting to the existence of such technology. after reading this information a knowledgeable ufo investigator will understand how difficult it may be to conclude from an objects behavior which scenario it belongs to.  \n",
      "i've always said that if \"they\" are coming here from a \"distant\" solar system, then *they're probably not packing their lunch for the whole trip and stopping for \"gas\" or “a burger” on the way. this would mean they're completely self-sufficient and probably very well resourced with recyclable material and advanced energy technologies.*  \n",
      "**you should think about that previous paragraph very carefully. it probably is the most important realization you can ever come to**. the ramifications are astounding. \"if\" that is true, then it means that the possibility of limitless and extremely inexpensive energy is real. it also means that true and limitless abundance is imminent. it is our destiny.  \n",
      "the evidence uncovered from my research leads me to understand that the whole ufo phenomenon is kept secret primarily not because of the \"et\" aspect of it, - although that does scare some people out of their mind, but mainly because of the ramifications which would inevitably cause the current economic and geopolitical structure to collapse. a collapse which is inevitable due to the consequences of the technology related to sustenance, energy and travel. as it turns out, this scares some other people completely out of their mind. these are the people who currently control the world systems of culture, economy, and energy. these are the people we get our information from, and who make public and economic policy decisions “in our best interest”. these are the people who decide who has “the need to know”.  \n",
      "what would happen to the current \"control structures\" which exist now if that type of technology were actually revealed and used to its full potential? what happens to an economy which is based on the consumption of fuels when the cost of such energy becomes zero? imagine removing energy cost from every product. what happens when recycling becomes a zero cost endeavor and all consumption is only a onetime depletion? the whole “planned obsolescence” which keeps you buying consumables goes right out the window. what happens when travel becomes limitless with zero “cost”? where do our boundaries go?  \n",
      "what happens to culture? this leads one to imagine a society where anyone can have anything, anytime, and go anywhere: a world where \"waste\" doesn't exist because energy concerns are irrelevant in the recycling process. a completely different existence where there is no need for any type of economy - because it's imaginary anyway. a society where all necessities are a right, free to all and you're only life goal is to explore, learn and contribute to the existence of the whole. zero strife, zero stress, and zero conflict: a world completely different in every aspect in comparison to what exists today. the challenges would only be sociological acceptance and change, and not the perceived difficulties of limits on resources and illusionary struggle for necessities.  \n",
      "what would happen to the people who kept this secret when it is disclosed this has existed for who knows how long and the population realizes what has been done to them and the planet for so long, only for their “rulers'” own selfish control based gains? what happens when the population of the planet realizes about the untold numbers of unnecessary deaths which occurred because of this situation?  \n",
      "what will that transition period be like? this is to be seen, but that transition is unavoidable; this cannot be kept secret forever. these are the real reasons behind ufo secrecy. i believe that amnesty is the only way forward, but some people may not be so forgiving. these are the fears which perpetuate the ufo secrecy. richard dolan in recent interviews concerning his new book, ad, after disclosure agrees with these points, but his assessment only considers them after contact happens. i will show you how we can make these changes first to allow contact to happen effortlessly.  \n",

      "i can’t help but think of the end scene in the movie “the day the earth stood still” (1951) in which the visiting alien states “it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet. but if you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out cinder. your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration. we shall be waiting for your answer; the decision rests with you.”  \n",
      "the possibilities are on the extremes and quite obvious. we can either grow into a peaceful and self perpetuating society or continue on our current path to certain demise because of the diminishing resources we consume. this consumption will inevitably result in wars over those resources, leading to certain destruction of our planet.  \n",
      "there is only one wise choice. it's my opinion that this has taken far too long to be actualized. the deep resistance to a severe societal and control change appears to be drastic and unacceptable to far too many. i believe this is why the whole ufo scenario is still a secret; not because of the existence of \"off-world\" intelligences. i think that's a nearsighted and readily available excuse; an illusion perpetuated by the fear-based focus on emotional misunderstandings. this conclusion is revealed by the close examination of the \"abduction\" scenarios. most humans immediately resonate in fear after a contact scenario. their immediate emotional response is understandable. they are confronted with paradigm shifting realizations, and situations which are out of their normal realm. but when the data is analyzed, most of the evidence point to the aliens’ intent as promoting evolution/enlightenment and a  \n",
      " deep care for the planet and all the occupants of the earth itself. there is an abundance of data provided by psychotherapists who have many years of regression therapy sessions which attribute to this conclusion. i believe aliens have this viewpoint because they understand the entanglement principle of quantum physics to its fullest reality; just as all the sages of antiquity have professed, - everything is connected.  \n",
      "meanwhile, advertisers have known for years that fear is an excellent motivator and closes down rational thought. one must logically conclude if aliens are here and wanted “resources” from us - as a certain well known physicists has recently claimed, in the centuries of reported encounters they certainly could have taken whatever they wanted. their obviously superior technology could have easily destroyed us already. we’re still here. it’s plain to see they don’t need our resources and that’s not their plan. as i’ve said earlier, “they’re not packing their lunch for the trip”. they seem to have everything they need. using fear, the people who refuse to accept this change perpetuate false realities for their own agendas while inhibiting the natural progress of human technological advancements, and by extension retarding the evolution of human consciousness.  \n",
      "we’re rapidly approaching an opportunity to prepare our society to be ready to have an equal and bidirectional relationship with our galactic neighbors. we should not be wasting that chance. we should be ready when that time comes. this isn’t about “disclosure” just yet. we’re not ready for that. we’ve only just begun to understand what that would mean. we first need to stop being “the planet of the children” and grow up.  \n",

      "a third research paper is titled: engineering the zero-point field and polarizable vacuum for interstellar flight, by h .e. puthoff, s.r. little, and m. ibison, institute for advanced studies at austin, austin texas. the initial paragraph reads: “a theme that has come to the fore in advanced planning for long-range space exploration is the concept of “propellantless propulsion” or “field propulsion”. one version of this concept involves the projected possibility that empty space itself (the quantum vacuum, or space- time metric) might be manipulated so as to provide energy/thrust for future space vehicles \\[1\\]. although far reaching, such a proposal is solidly grounded in modern theory that describes the vacuum as a polarizable medium that sustains energetic quantum fluctuations. thus the possibility that matter/vacuum interactions might be engineered for space-flight applications is not a priori ruled out, although certain constraints need to be acknowledged. the structure and implications of such a far-reaching hypothesis are considered herein.” \\[source; hyperlink \"http://www.gravitycontrol.org/pdf/jbiszpe.pdf\" http://www.gravitycontrol.org/pdf/ jbiszpe.pdf\\]  \n",
      "these papers are right from leading research organizations sanctioned by our very own government. they are intense with physics equations, but in essence they say that almost limitless speed is possible by electromagnetically cancelling out mass which provides an environment for zero inertia. with zero inertia there is no g-force, and without mass unlimited acceleration is feasible. is this not exactly what is witnessed by the behavior of the ufos in our skies; instantaneous accelerations and immediate directional  \n",

      "i believe that covers the propulsion aspect quite convincingly, at least proving that there are theories and experiments which would provide the capabilities which are observed by ufo’s. but does there exist the energy sources to accomplish this?  \n",
      "again we can go to the u.s. patent office for those answers, but first i’d like to acknowledge the work of dr. steven greer and his efforts to bring the energy situation to a public light. in his groundbreaking document entitled: “summary of breakthrough energy technologies; prepared for: the president of the united states and members of the us congress” he outlines the current state of technology, the reasons and methods for suppression, and the most advantageous methods for implementing these right now.  \n",
      "the introduction states: “this summary document was prepared for the purpose of providing general background information about energy-producing technologies that are outside the usual mainstream consideration or awareness. this document is based on nearly 17 years of research by dr. greer, dr. loder and other members of the orion project, who have been studying energy generation and propulsion technologies. we have identified a number of new energy technologies that within 6 months to several years, given proper funding, may be ready for marketing.”  \n",
      "dr. greer has presented this repeatedly to government authorities but to this day there has been neither public acknowledgement nor action, which i believe is primarily because of the economic and societal concerns stated toward the beginning of this article. the reasons and methods for the suppression as he’s discovered are included in section 1.5 of that document and are numerous. they are documented and witnessed by people directly interviewed by dr. greer. the conclusion of that section states “considering the multiplicity of suppression techniques described above, a lone inventor or conventional r and d company can in no way overcome such obstacles. therefore, a strategic plan and capability commensurate with these barriers must be devised and executed in order for these new technologies to succeed.” \\[source: hyperlink \"http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf\" http://www.theorionproject.org/energy.pdf\\] dr. greer’s paper does an excellent job of demonstrating such a strategic plan to accomplish that goal.  \n",
      "there are a number of u.s. patents which describe what has become to be known as “overunity devices”. these devices create more energy as a product than they require for operation. the argument against that comes from people who cite the “law of conservation of energy” which states that the amount of energy created will always be equal to or less than that which is input”. the caveat is that law applies only to a “closed system” and these devices work on “open system” theories. these devices receive most of their energy from the active environment, which current physics hasn’t yet incorporated into their calculations. think of it like this; current physics counts the gas tank of your car along with the engine as a closed system. the only source of energy is what is held by that gas tank. in an open system the tank would be constantly filled from an outside source as it uses its reserves, but current physics can’t count that because it doesn’t understand how it’s being refueled. in an open system it would appear to conventional physics as if energy was created from nothingness because they couldn’t detect the filling mechanism. in these cases the filling mechanism is the electromagnetic fabric of the space/time reality which supports matter as we understand it. it’s where atoms get their energy from. another simple example is a waterwheel. the river is the source of the water. that water is replenished from rainfall. that rainfall is an example of an open system, and can’t be adequately calculated.  \n",

      "in conclusion, based on my research i believe the world could, - and should - be completely different than the situation we face today. if the advent of limitless energy were a reality there would be no necessity for strife or the unnecessary condition of being “poor”. with the cost of energy removed from every aspect of our society, and transportation becoming a limitless availability the world could change very rapidly into the “star trek” generation we all have visions of the future becoming. the only necessity would be one where the individual makes the most of him or herself, ideally for the betterment of mankind and contributing to the experience of the whole. the only “currency” that would ever be necessary would be the creativity one brings with them to the overall experience of humanity.  \n",
      "there will be a very painful transition period which i believe we as a society can endure. the few people who are benefiting most from the current situation have the most to lose, while the vast majority of humans on this planet will have unimaginable gains as the result. we are being offered a world where true equality actually exists.  \n",
      "if we can handle this change, then i think we truly will be ready to seriously think about open contact with our galactic visitors. from the majority of the reports, this is exactly what those visitors are waiting for. we should be well prepared to stand on equal footing as peers when the time to greet our neighbors and join the galactic community arrives. it will take a global “team effort”. as it turns out “we are who we’ve been waiting for”. i personally am tired of waiting. how about you?  \n",

      "&gt; he has a great idea about the structure of an advanced spacefaring civilization. his initial assumptions for the idea are: aliens exist &amp; they have crafts which can travel at very high speeds where time relativity becomes relevant. his example: if a being’s planet is 2000 light years from earth and its ship can make the distance is 1 week. then in one trip to earth the time passage on the beings home plant(4000 years for a round trip) would be to impractical to be plausible because that being would likely be coming back to a world which forgot it even left. thus, such an advanced civilization would not be strapped down to one planet, and the civilizations structure would resemble a nomadic culture. e.g. two beings could be at point a and then they could separate and each travel for one week to planets x and y respectively(assuming these planets were one weeks travel away) and then meet back at point b to compare notes. although for the beings only two weeks went by, on planets x any y 4000 years have passed. now in all likelihood there would be millions or billions of craft and operators and a very complex navigation system to ensure a functioning society. also, undoubtably, the highest virtue in this culture would be punctuality. what’s cool about this idea is that the same being could have been visiting earth for all of human history and from its perspective it could just seem like a few years, months, or maybe even weeks.\n",

      "\n",
      "if they are genetically self-modified they may have evolved past the need to carry infants, assuming they once gave live birth, and developed synthetic wombs, which additionally may allow prolonged brain growth, sort of like having a fourth trimester. \n",

      "not all technological influences may be spiritually dangerous as laid out above (and it goes without saying also physically dangerous). some might be beneficial to the evolution of higher spiritual natures and consciousness. for example, humans diverged from other large animals on this planet in several ways linked to technological progress. early human societies congregated at rivers and other rich locations and collectively managed resources in what might be called a proto-agricultural lifestyle, with horticulture, animal capture, livestock management ( [ecology and society: salmon, science, and reciprocity on the northwest coast](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art43/)) use of preparation to seperate the inedible and toxic, fire and cooking to harvest wild grains and other plants to supplement food. construction of physical structures was used to corral migratory herd animals together so that that the local human population density could be increased greatly. compare us with bears. bears have large food requirement and only occasional interact closely at locations where the food supply can temporarily sustain them, such as on the river bank. the inability of bears to cooperate results in them having to live apart and police their large personal ranges as mostly solitary animals as there is insufficient food for concentrations of bears to form for long periods. \n",
      "\n",
      "humans changed the food supply by food preparation, knowledge and later by fire, so the bioavailable fraction of energy in an area is greater, so humans could form larger villages and societies, eventually leading to civilisation, with writing, money and laws. we use each other as tools, so we do not need to carry more than a pair of limbs for manipulating anything, and through our social nature, we can amplify our ability to engineer. \n",
      "\n",
      "the higher population density in turn allow for cultures to mix, bringing multiple innovations together, accelerating this process. we could call this *techno-spiritual evolution*. as this process yielded eventually professional farmers, we can see that to kill or harm a farmer - our neighbour - reduces the total available food supply, so we would all be fighting more over what remained, and therefore harming ourselves. we therefore are better adapted not to kill our neighbours. without professional farmers, we would reduce our food supply and be preoccupied with feeding ourselves, and not able to develop specialisations like weaving and shoe making.\n",
      "\n",
      "humans have the longest childhoods in the known animal kingdom, i believe only shared with the orangutan, which is the second most intelligent primate after us. it suggests that childhood length and intelligence are intrinsically linked. human infants more so have extraordinary nutrient demand for brain growth - a new born human beings brain uses about half of all the energy intake, which is an extraordinary fraction. this is dependent on secure food supply, and therefore the ability to optimise the food production of our environment by either high intelligence or use of technology, like fishing, corralling wild animals and spears for hunting, cooking, and having excellent memory and cultural knowledge for what is and isn't edible, and how to prepare it so it is so. \n",
      "\n",
      "our ancestors probably also travelled in organised ways to better harvest the land over the different seasons, having excellent geographical knowledge and awareness of natural cycles, in order to optimise their food security.\n",
      "\n",
      "all this, seems important to the development of an animal with an unusually large brain to body ratio and brain metabolic fraction of total energy intake. we see bigger brained animals than us, like elephants and whales, but their brains generally simply scale with size, so the fraction of nutrients consumed by the brain is much less. this along with the physical stress of giving birth with narrow hips to large crania and the strain of supporting it on land and a small physical frame, shows that humans have been under a large-brain selection pressure for a prolonged time, moreso than any other animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "this in turn, is quite possibly, at least in the later stages, a result of our bodies being well adapted, as bipeds, to physically manipulating the environment, and so the benefit of a bigger brain with more generalised intelligence, or consciousness, may provide a bigger evolutionary advantage in such bodies of this physical form, enough to overcome the survival reducing effect of higher energy use, and the balance between these two counter-acting forces being what makes our evolution of large brains so fast. we could say, that the brain to body ratio follows the form, as the physical form provides the power to physically translate higher intelligence into a survival advantage to each increase in intelligence. this also is to say, that technology is a natural part of the driver for higher intelligence and consciousness.\n",
      "\n",
      "so strong has been the selective pressure to higher intelligence been in humans that we have not only comparatively large brains, but as compared to our cetacean friends, our brains are unusually integrated and well connected, whereas in the huge brained whales, the brain is more composed of lobes that process different functions in isolation. when we think, we use more of our brain, due to a more developed connectome, which means that the equivalent brain volume would be higher, showing that we have continued to push the envelop out of how much brain we can use on a task beyond the physical limits of our frames. so our virtual brain size is larger than it looks (birds also have this feature through even more dense neural packing and less glia per neuron).\n",

      "here we see an idea i think is very important as to 'why us', this strange bipedal mammal with the extremely strong brain selection, 'domain-general cognition'. this phrase seems to me to be broadly equivalent to consciousness, and i assume that is the case. although human consciousness has probably additional aspects that may be a result of socialisation and thereby identity, such as awareness of self, and awareness of awareness. many animals possess intelligence and enough domain-general cognition, that simply increasing the brain size results in an enhanced ability to deploy tools or behaviors, individually or socially, that results in a better environment for them. if the bird had no beak, it might not have been able to evolve that much intelligence, since beaks are in part tools, in the absence of upper limbs that can be used to manipulate. the elephant too, has a trunk, and it has the largest brain of any animal on land, it can't use its forelimbs well as they are weight bearing. \n",
      "\n",
      "having the existence of these gives higher intelligence an increased survival advantage despite its increased energy cost, so it changes the set-point to a relatively bigger brain compared to closely related species; so the brain seems to follow form, but form cannot be very advantageous either without some kind of domain-general cognition. so they are in a positive feedback loop, and humans manifest an obvious example of it. perhaps this implies that aliens also are commonly humanoid.\n",
      "\n",
      "i would propose that;\n",
      "\n",
      "selective pressure (increased survival advantage of a brainier gene) = (increased domain-general intelligence \\* physical translatability) / (energy cost + physical restriction (from gene)) \n",
      "\n",
      "where *physical translatability* here relates to the ability to modify the environment by the physical form, i.e. has dexterous limbs that are free of supporting the body, and that social intelligence also increases this by allowing people to share effort and limbs, and this also creates an amplifier to increased domain-generalised intelligence by knowledge sharing, and *energy cost* would also include childhood and parenting, and be sensitive more to the ratio of energy used by the brain to the body, and *physical cost* i.e. having to support mass affects the ability to move, the physical strain of carrying the baby and giving birth to a large head. note that in humans, childhood interactions with parents have a huge impact on intelligence, as well as through schools, according to prof james flynn. \n",
      "\n",
      "as we have moved so far in the direction of being 'brainy' then the two terms in the numerator must be maxed out and that the denominator, the energy cost and brain size would be reduced by improvements in the way the brain is networked in humans. in birds something similar has happened, they get more brains per gram but in their case this is in part a necessity due to the lift capacity of their wings. this has allowed a lower cost for higher intelligence, and so they have become very smart, equivalent in aspects to monkeys, dogs, and human children. \n",
      "\n",
      "we might also wonder why whales would have big brains, given they can't do a lot but swim. but they also have to move huge distances, they can engineer their immediate environment and food intake by choices related to moving, and sharing intelligence. in turn the benefits to them of that create a more secure food supply, so the energy cost is not a significant impediment of having a bigger brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "this ought to be, in very rough form, a universal formula for the evolution of intelligence, but that is just in my view. the relative consumption of resting energy by the brain is probably highest in humans and the tree shrew, and that the percentage of energy used by the brain should be more valuable than the brain to body ratio. having a high brain to body (energy) ratio might not mean you are the cleverest creature out there, but it does suggest that the selective pressure is most strongly shifted to higher intelligence in these animals.\n",

      "is every \"hard step\" equally hard? i'm a layman, but it seems that the hardest steps would be the ones where evolution does its thing over billions of years. that's a lot of time to go nowhere and fail. but as life forms move up the ladder, the steps become easier. we humans now know how to avoid extinction from plagues, famines, wars, and natural disasters. even nuclear war would leave a few survivors. we actually do have ideas about how to control and reverse climate change. even if bad things are on the horizon, we as a species are hardly doomed. our technology, since the industrial revolution, has advanced exponentially compared to ancient civilizations, where technology stayed mostly the same for periods of thousands of years. because of those giant leaps during the industrial revolution, working out new technology is far easier than it was. the modern electric computer was invented in the us in 1946. 23 years later, we landed on the moon. \n",

      "**what**  \n",
      "decades ago ufo programs were hidden from oversight. for true disclosure to occur it would mean that those presently in charge would need to come forward and accept the consequences and liabilities of years of governmental deceit. given our built-in desires for self-preservation, this means that full disclosure will likely never happen. therefore, providing amnesty for those in these rogue ufo organizations may be the only way to get genuine governmental level disclosure. amnesty does not guarantee public disclosure, but it does seek to ensure that those in government who should be informed to make these decisions are informed. an amnesty solution retains full confidentiality of people and data. it is up to the appropriate governmental bodies to decide what can and should be released to the public. to help make this amnesty-driven disclosure a reality the #ufoamnesty project aims to create political and public discourse on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**why**\n",
      "\n",
      "currently, a major issue is that the public interest is fleeting. when these short bursts of interest occur the public’s energy and interest is not meaningfully utilized. most people get started in this topic very interested, they then do nothing and mentally put the ufo topic away until the next news comes along. for the large majority of the public this cycle of excitement with new news and then no action repeats itself. this means that most of the public's interest is never developed or used. those who could be activated for more action to help disclosure progression never end up contributing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**how**\n",
      "\n",
      "the #ufoamnesty project aims to galvanize and activate the public interest through meaningful, viral campaigns with clear objectives and call to actions. this starts from creating a credible apolitical project that the general public can participate in without cost, and while minimizing social stigma.\n",
      "\n",
      "as this push for ufo amnesty should be apolitical, (as it does support any one party, agenda, individual or group) it should be a mission where even the likes of steven greer and lue elizondo can give joint support. this should mean we can unify all parts of the ufo community, and more importantly the wider general public, under one mission that drives mass public actions in support of amnesty for rogue ufo programs.\n",

      "\n",
      "to achieve these 2 goals we will use 3 overarching strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. viral social media &amp; physical marketing campaigns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* think of campaigns like [#blackouttuesday](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8d8n/the-blackouttuesday-instagram-meme-is-silencing-black-voices)\n",
      "* global online efforts in co-ordinated social media and offline community marketing campaigns\n",
      "* using viral campaigns we achieve mass awareness and mass action (via clear cta’s in campaigns)\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. effective use of existing public interest:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **free influencers:** many celebrities/influencers will give free campaign exposure if used correctly. from the likes of demi lovato to julius dein (facebook’s most-watched page), these celebrities have a genuine interest in ufo’s that we can capture to support campaigns for free - granting us billions in views and reach for free.\n",
      "* **mass public action:** galavazing interest under singular mass public campaigns internationally. these could be political petitions, to media pitching or emails/letters to politicians. this also includes creating an easy-to-share an archive of links that include links to existing articles, interviews, videos and more to share with friends and family to make it easier for organic virality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. effective use of all media types:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **creating discourse regarding ufo technologies ability to solve climate &amp; energy issues**  \n",
      "\n",
      "   * this is a topic not yet discussed which can activate eco-conscious activism &amp; new people\n",
      "   * increasing this awareness is a whole new way to reach a whole new segment of the public\n",
      "   * we should also do this using partnership with organizations from the dicaprio foundation to secure the likes of sustainability icons such as david attenborough &amp; greta thunberg\n",
      "   * pitching to eco journalists and those in climate science will also help secure coverage\n",
      "* **new media:** youtube channels, podcasts, tiktok, meme pages, influencers\n",
      "* **traditional media:** tv news, newspapers, magazines\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#8203;\n",
      "\n",
      "    tactics:  \n",
      "\n",
      "**free marketing seeding**\n",
      "\n",
      "to seed campaigns, we should be using existing ufo interest groups first. initially, we can consider these across 3 major groups, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **the hyper engaged community:**  \n",
      "***definition:*** these are the people who read ufo subreddits and are on ufo twitter every day to read up on and potentially engage online in the topic. these people do intentional check-ins frequently on the subject. (estimated 1%-5% of the ufo community)  \n",
      "***use:*** these are the people we can rely on for free initial grass-roots pushes, and potentially physical marketing. this includes for example mass pitching for coverage to journalists, news sites/social pages, tv shows, radio and vloggers. these groups eill also help with physical campaigns, for example - college campuses activation to activate gen z student activism.\n",
      "2. **the disengaged community:**  \n",
      "***definition:*** these are people who were very interested initially, but through years of disappointment have become less engaged but are still interested in updates. with appropriate engagement, these can become members of the hyper engaged community (estimated 50-75% of the ufo community)  \n",
      "***use:*** these are the people we must update and re-energize. this should start with easy, low commitment things like viewing, liking and sharing. they should then gradually be funneled to more high level participation activities like signing petitions, posting on own socials etc\n",
      "3. **the interested celebrities &amp; influencers**  \n",
      "***definition:*** these are the public figures who have a genuine interest in the topic and so will offer free support if approached and activated correctly. this includes celebrities like demi lovato, leonardo dicaprio and post malone. this also includes digital celebrities/influencers, like large viral tiktokers and ig/fb influencers in all niches, from logan paul, to faze clan and joe rogan.  \n",
      "***use:*** these are the people who will help us achieve free distribution to billions globally. to activate these they will be included in things like panel livestream ama’s and pre-seeding campaigns if we do things like 1 day lead up viral events.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#8203;\n",
      "\n",
      "    markerting campaign #1: occupy 1 day globally  \n",
      "\n",
      "whether it be one of world's first viral activism campaigns like kony 2012, or the more recent [#blackouttuesday](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8d8n/the-blackouttuesday-instagram-meme-is-silencing-black-voices) campaign, it’s clear that focusing public energy to 1-day can greatly increase the odds of participation. this can be explained in 2 main reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **with everyone posting the same thing at once it becomes socially acceptable to do so.**  \n",
      "for a regular campaign it’s hard anyway to get mass public engagement. most people feel insecure about posting; worrying they won’t get likes or they’ll be judged for the opinion. make it a ufo topic and it’s even harder due to the stigma. therefore, having a day to activate everyone at once will greatly help people feel more comfortable in posting as they aren’t doing this alone at a random time. instead they do it with thousands of others and well respected public figures.\n",
      "2. **with everyone sharing at once it socially guilts you to not be involved - if the barrier to be involved is as simple as a story share or signing of online petition and reposting the confirmation page.** people follow other people. if all your friends are posting on social media about a social justice campaign and you don’t - you’re the odd one one out who doesn’t care. therefore, having one day where anyone can easily join with a few taps will increase the odds of success.\n",
      "3. **hype - the build up to the day, the excitement of being part of a movement together**\n",
      "4. **belief in the possibility of effecting change through participation**\n",
      "\n",
      "if #ufoamnesty uses the 1 day approach these would be some considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **assets:** video and image assets must be prepped and provided for distribution to the community and optimized for each social. ideally we should have 1 hero video posted everywhere that has a montage of the most credible media and ends with a clear cta at the end. for example, this could start off with the flir footage, have cuts of reputable news stories quotes, articles and government personnel interviews internationally.  \n",
      "the primary cta at the end of this video should be to repost/retweet at the most basic level.  \n",
      "the deeper level of cta’s should be to sign petitions, and to attend the next day's livestream ama where the global public has a chance to ask questions to the likes of lue (if he’s on board with this), and other governmental advisors. ideally we can use the day's hype to also encourage the world to join the next day on a livestream ama with ideally the likes of luis e, christopher m, and other international government personnel who are comfortable being open about the ufo subject and are vetted, credible official personnel.\n",
      "2. **clear cta’s:** aside from asking for posting and retweeting of media, the campaign must also have different levels of engagement for more the different levels of motivated public participants. for example, pre-written tweets to tweet local government representatives, to petition signatures. some public participants will want to help as much as they can, whereas others will simply want to reshare online and not do more than that. for this reason we need to ensure we have 1 core cta, but also secondary and tertiary cta’s for those who want to help in as many ways as possible.\n",
      "3. **launch day strategy:** while the campaign should aim to build hype for maximum participation on the day of the campaign, we must also ensure we have strategies to find and capture those whose interest is sparked the most who can become part of “the hyper engaged community”. for these people we must have active efforts to engage with those engaging in the campaign on the day. we must also have appropriate “nets” to identify and retain communication with these people for future pushes. this can be with email or phone sign ups, to follows on campaigns socials.\n",
      "4. **ongoing campaigns:** there must be a developed strategy to appropriately capture the hype built on the day, and on the next day's livestream ama. this should be done in mind to decide how best to maximize the hype and build the community for future campaigns.\n",
      "5. **recruitment -** we are only as good as the team. with this in mind, both during the campaign and ongoing we need to focus on recruitment as this is when hype will peak. whether these are marketeers, scientists, politicians, teachers, students - whatever. we need a systematized way people can apply to volunteer help, then a method to meaningfully use all of this help and direct this activity.\n",

      "\n",
      "&gt;the octopus is a solitary creature. it has no social bonds, no social hierarchy. it makes us rethink the evolutionary reasons for play. in fact, much of our idea of intelligence is based on the idea that it evolved out of a social need.

      "the [evolution of cephalopds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution_of_cephalopods) dates back to deep sea. where i'm going with that? well think about the possibilities. what if the invertebrates with neurons spread over their bodies kept developing intelligence over the millions of years? trying to think very outside the box, what if life also developed a very different path from ours right in our own earth, how confusing, different and exotic this other form of life could be, to the point where we wouldn't even undersand it. in my own wonders, i think how would a species like that interact with it's own envirionment, **how the pressure would affect their movement,** how technology could be developed, how would a different form of intelligence approach physics, harvest [eletromagnetic energy from volcanos](https://schmidtocean.org/cruise/magnetic-anomalies-at-the-worlds-largest-volcano/) and [use magma](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/science/axial-volcano-mapping.html) to travel through them?\n",

      " location: pine lake park / manchester, new jersey / time: approximately 6-7 a.m. / eye-witness report... so i was out on the evening of 10/17/21 and there is a lake right around the corner from my house, so me and a friend decided to take a walk down there just to have something to do.... what i saw this night cannot be explained, and since i had left my phone at the house because it literally had 0 charge when i left, i did not capture any of what happened the night of 10/17/21.... however... the very next morning the second i woke up with a fully charged phone, i went back... and i am so happy i did!!!! so the first thing i have to do is link my youtube channel in here so you can get to my video collection, and then i will list the specific videos to check out and specific times to watch as well as specific things to look for... youtube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/stevetube85](https://www.youtube.com/user/stevetube85) ... so watch as many of the videos i posted you want, watch them all, watch from front to back, weird things are happening the entire time... i just want to point out the most dramatic things i've found so far - find video named img\\_0029 - start at 30 second mark, put speakers or headphones on the loudest setting they go and listen to the reptilian literally speaking to me... next find img\\_0030, start at 25 seconds in and do the same thing and listen for the same thing... next find img\\_0031 and start at 10 seconds in and same again.... now first and foremost, i did not hear this voice while i was actually filming.... this is where it gets interesting - these videos were all recorded from an iphone 11 - i tried to get the files off the phone to itunes, facebook, to my pc, to an external hard drive, i did everything in my power even trying to edit them down because i thought it was a time issue or something, but whatever the case may be - i could not get the videos off my phone to save my life.... and i consider myself to be pretty computer savvy.... soooo.... how to share this with the world??? i was literally losing my mind trying to upload to facebook or youtube... someone had to see this, i had to share it with the world.... something was preventing me from doing that.... soooooo.... i get out my iphone 6s + that i've just kept around as a back up and spare phone, and i record the recordings that are on the iphone 11 because it was like they were locked... all i was able to do with those files at the end of it all was delete them from my phone....so here i am re-recording every single video i took, just recording another recording, literally.....after i am all done i watch each video again just to make sure i didn't mess anything up or miss one and so forth.... this is when the voice reveals itself... it was there the whole time but i never heard it in real time/real life/while originally filming.... it was always there in my original recording but somehow masked... maybe whatever it was, and you will hear it, somehow is what created the lock on my phone that disabled me from taking them off my phone... i swear to god or to whatever the highest possible spiritual being/our creator is that i am not making this up, these videos are un-edited, 100% this is genuine..... ok - so back to the other videos, which ones and where to start and what to look for.... find video img\\_0034 - start at about 20 seconds, img\\_0036, start around 30 seconds, img\\_0036 watch again in slow motion if possible, from 30 seconds up until 2:40 mark, and you can see what i am about to describe..... so i don't even know where to begin with this one, but it definitely had something to do with the activity that i am so upset i did not capture the night before.... there was one ufo that appeared to have either landed on the island in the middle of the lake or at least come very close to it... then shooting stars started coming down, not like in troves, but one here, one there, spaced out by several minutes each.... but they all appeared to land on the island... so since i didn't capture any of this, i can only imagine what they were doing... however, whatever they dropped off on that island, in the morning it began to materialize and nano-bots were literally swimming in the water in groups that appeared to be bubbles but you will clearly see that is not the case in my videos.... these nano-bot aquatic \"things\" literally form some type of chain like network in the water right in front of my eyes, and on camera... i look to the left to check some bubbles approaching, look to the right again and the chain has already expanded 10x, look back to the left and same thing.... this network surrounded the entire lake... the network chain eventually was just all linked together at the shoreline... the weird thing is also, the very next day i went back again and i went early i even brought my fishing gear with me in case i saw these things again i was going to try and snag a piece of it to see what it was.... but it was gone.... it was like the day before never even happened.... \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_again, the network/chain/nano-creatures/etc videos to look for are: img\\_0034 - start at about 20 seconds, img\\_0036, start around 30 seconds, img\\_0036 watch again in slow motion if possible, from 30 seconds up until 2:40 mark, and you can see what i am about to describe..... and one more time the videos with the reptilian voice: img\\_0029 - start at 30 second mark, put speakers or headphones on the loudest setting they go and listen to the reptilian literally speaking to me... next find img\\_0030, start at 25 seconds in and do the same thing and listen for the same thing... next find img\\_0031 and start at 10 seconds in and same again....\n",

      "i‘ve been asking myself that for quite some time now. when i say space warfare, i’m refering to multiple parties separated by space, like two planetary colonies fighting. obviously it would be a very slow and long ranged endeavor. i have multiple scenarios i’d like your opinion on. 1. interplanetary warfare. i think this is probably the easiest, but also most destructive way to fight. just launch a rod of metal at another planet fast enough and you have essentially a nuke. how could you be able to protect yourself from this kind of thing? perhaps something like a missile defense system? idk i‘d like your opinions on that. 2. fighting in space assuming you managed to protect yourself from just plain missiles or you actually plan to send down a land invasion force, you would probably have to engage in space. i imagine something similar to submarines fighting, with additional predicaments like heat management. also how would you track an enemy spaceship and how would you try to hide yourself? what do you guys think of this. and finally 3.conquering a planet. what would be the best way to land ground troups on a planet? you could consider dropping „planes“ carrying the troups into orbit? i‘d love some responses.\n"

    "'Men In Black (MIB) is a government entity that researches & monitors the sentiment of people on aliens, whether conspiracies that are made are a little too close to things that the people should not know about. They are requesting us, the Reddit Data Science team to create a model to classify reddit posts and identify the key words that differentiates the post from \"Aliens\" to \"Space\". This would facilitate MIB's intelligence collection efforts about sentiments from ordinary citizens. This information can also be useful for other associations to promote its marketing effort on social media, events and podcasts, that in turn can feed information to the mainstream.<br><br>\n",
    "All the models trained were able to classify the posts accurately, with a F1 score between 89% to 91% and an AUC of 96% to 97%, but we chose Tfidf vectorizer and Logistic Regression model as it is easier to interpret. The model makes its predictions by using the coefficients of each word in the post and calculates the odds of it belonging to alien subreddit or it not belonging to alien subreddit.<br><br>\n",
